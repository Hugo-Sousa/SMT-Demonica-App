He confronts the righteous souls to prevent them from praying for the wicked. Elsewhere, this role of the prince of Gehenna is instead given to Ashmedai, Satan, Abaddon or Samael. While English translations of the Bible often treat Gehenna and Hell interchangeably, the concept has a distinct meaning in rabbinic literature and in kabbalah, closer to the notion of purgatory. Gehenna is a place where a soul resides briefly (at most for a year) and becomes aware of all own deeds, rather than one of eternal damnation.\n\nIn Praxis cabulae nigrae Doctoris Johannis Fausti, Magi celeberrimi, a book written in 1612, Aciel (Alciel) is one of seven \"planetary spirits,\" a concept present already in earlier writing related to the character of Faust.These spirits were regarded as servants of Lucifer, and the more famous Mepistopheles has his origin among them. In at least one similar Faustian text, Aciel was specifically identified as the demon associated with the sun."

At the command of a mage, Amon may take the shape of man with a raven's head, having teeth of a canine. He tells of all things past and future. According to the Grand Grimoire, he is a direct subordinate of Satanachia.\n\nHe procures love and reconciles controversies between friends and foes. Some demonologists have associated his name with the Egyptian god Amun or with the god Ba‘al Hammon of Carthage.\n\nAs Amaymon, also known as Amoymon or Amaimon, he is said to be a Prince of Hell who represents the sin of Wrath and King of either the West or East. Asmoday and sometimes Gaap are said to be his servants. A silver ring is required to be worn on the middle finger when summoning him, as his deadly breath will kill the summoner otherwise."

    "background":"Anat, also known as Anath, Anant, Anit, Anti, Anaitis, Anait, Anthat or Antit, is a western Semitic goddess of war and mistress of wild animals, also associated with love and sex. In mythical texts, she is famous for having a violent temperament and for taking joy in slaughter.\n\nIn the Baal Cycle texts, Anat appears as a war goddess, initially called upon by her father El alongside the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis to set the stage for the coronation of Yam; Anat, however, favors Baal, who is called her brother in this myth; outside Ugarit Hadad's sister was Hebat, however, and unlike Baal, Anat is not called Dagon's descendant in Ugaritic texts. After the defeat of the sea god she helps Baal secure the support of Asherah and threatens her father to let Baal build his own palace. She is later described ritually re-enacting a battle, and then purifying herself in her temple, where she receives a message from Baal asking her to establish peace on terms favorable to him. In response, she lists various past adversaries she vanquished to confirm she is a suitable goddess for this task. In the second half of the epic, she avenges her brother by killing Mot and with the help of the sun goddess, Shapash, brings Baal back from the land of the dead. This myth might represent the cycle of seasons, a single catastrophic drought, or perhaps simply another purely mythical conflict over divine kingship.\n\nIn the tale of Aqhat, Anat desires to obtain the legendary bow of the eponymous hero. After he rejects her various offers and taunts the goddess, stating that women have no business using such weapons, Anat, with her father's permission, devises a plan which culminates in his death and destruction of the bow.\n\nOther Ugaritic texts, especially apotropaic formulas, usually pair Anat with Astarte, who shared many of her functions, and is also often assumed to be Baal's wife by researchers. In the Baal cycle, they only appear together once, preventing Baal from attacking Ym's messengers. Sometimes, she was also associated with Resheph, a Canaanite god similar to the Mesopotamian plague deity Nergal. Like Anat, Resheph was known for his violent disposition.\n\nHer worship was introduced to Egypt, where she was also associated with Astarte, and was additionally considered the consort of the god Set, during the late bronze age conflated by the Egyptians with Baal Hadad and with Hittite weather gods. Her sexual aspects led her to be associated with Min, who is a god of male fertility. She was one of Rameses II's patron deities, who according to the pharaoh, watched over him in battle. He even named one of his daughters Bint-Anat, or \"Daughter of Anat\" in her honor.\n\nDuring the period of Babylonian exile, among the Hebrew inhabitants of the island of Elephantine, she was known as Anat-Yahu, the wife of Yahu (God). This association seemingly wasn't known in any other areas, and unlike fellow Canaanite deities Baal, Astarte and Asherah, Anat is not present in the Bible in any meaningful capacity, though \"Shamgar, son of Anath\" is a ruler mentioned in the Book of Judges."

In the old Vedic religion, they were simply gods of moral/social phenomenon who regularly competed with the Devas, who were gods of natural phenomenon.\n\nIn Hinduism, they are fanatical, demon-like entities associated with carnal and materialistic pleasures, and often thirsted for violence, opposed to the more peace-inclined Devas. There are many kings and rulers of the Asura, but one major Asura Lord is based on Virocana, also known as Maha Vairocana or Dainichi Nyorai, the king of the asuras who, alongside Indra, searched for the secret of enlightenment.\n\nIn Buddhism, they are the lowest rank of deities and are jealous gods addicted to various malign passions, while said to be one of the four unhappy births, being representative of a human being incapable of peace and always angered with the world, while also seeking strife and violence. In Japanese Buddhism, they are demigods, or semi-blessed beings. Powerful protectors of Buddhism, yet fierce and quarrelsome, they are partly good and partly evil, like humans. Their realm is believed to be a world of strife said to be located on the ocean floor. Some say Ashura was an Indian royal who converted to Buddhism. In other traditions, Ashura was a sun goddess who was feared for bringing droughts. The leaders of the Asuras were called Asurinda or Asurendra (\"Asura Lord\"). The principal leaders are Vemacritin (also called Vepacitti), Rahu (also called Veroca, Verocana, or Virocana) and Paharada. The appearance of the Megami Tensei series' Asura is most likely based on the Japanese Buddhist depiction of the Asuras.\n\nHowever, in Zoroastrianism, Asura is known as Ahura, and are depicted as the forces of good, led by Ahura Mazda. In fact, the Indo-Iranians, the term asura (or in this case ahura) originally referred to divine beings on par with the gods. After the Aryans went their separate ways from the Iranians, the asuras came to be seen as rival gods, eventually even demonic. The struggle between the devas and the asuras possibly reflects the conflict between the tribes who worshiped a pantheon led by the god Indra and the tribes who worshiped the gods called the asuras."

The black color of the third horse symbolized death and famine, bearing a scale of famine. The rider rides onward, denying the world life-sustaining food and bringing starvation, but being ordered by divine law to not harm oil or wine. The rider is shown holding a scale, which represents scarcity of food, higher prices and famine, likely as a result of the wars caused by the red horseman. Food will be scarce, but luxuries such as wine and oil will still be readily available.\n\nThe \"a measure of wheat for a penny\" from the King James Version of the Bible might not sound like a famine to modern ears, but in the NIV we read \"a quart of wheat for a day's wages,\" which is a little clearer. While it's never identified as his own, it is implied that the voice John the Apostle hears coming from \"the third of the four living creatures\" comes from the Black Rider, making it the only horseman that actually vocalizes his intentions, the aforementioned raise in prices."

She was the goddess of the earth, of agriculture, and of fertility in general. Sacred to her are livestock and agricultural products, poppy, narcissus and the crane. She is the mother of the Spring goddess Persephone.\n\nWhen Hades abducted and married her daughter Persephone to be his wife and queen in the Greek underworld, she punished the caretakers of Persephone into monsters. Then in a fit of anger and sorrow at her daughter's loss, Demeter laid a curse on the world that caused plants to wither and die, and the land to become desolate.\n\nZeus, alarmed for the barren earth, sought for Persephone's return. However, because she had eaten the pomegranate while in the underworld, Hades had a claim on her. Therefore, it was decreed that Persephone would spend four months each year in the underworld. During these months Demeter would grieve for her daughter's absence, withdrawing her gifts from the world, creating winter. Her return brought the spring."
