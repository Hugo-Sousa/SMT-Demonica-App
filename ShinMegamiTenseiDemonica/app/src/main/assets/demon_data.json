He confronts the righteous souls to prevent them from praying for the wicked. Elsewhere, this role of the prince of Gehenna is instead given to Ashmedai, Satan, Abaddon or Samael. While English translations of the Bible often treat Gehenna and Hell interchangeably, the concept has a distinct meaning in rabbinic literature and in kabbalah, closer to the notion of purgatory. Gehenna is a place where a soul resides briefly (at most for a year) and becomes aware of all own deeds, rather than one of eternal damnation.\n\nIn Praxis cabulae nigrae Doctoris Johannis Fausti, Magi celeberrimi, a book written in 1612, Aciel (Alciel) is one of seven \"planetary spirits,\" a concept present already in earlier writing related to the character of Faust.These spirits were regarded as servants of Lucifer, and the more famous Mepistopheles has his origin among them. In at least one similar Faustian text, Aciel was specifically identified as the demon associated with the sun."

At the command of a mage, Amon may take the shape of man with a raven's head, having teeth of a canine. He tells of all things past and future. According to the Grand Grimoire, he is a direct subordinate of Satanachia.\n\nHe procures love and reconciles controversies between friends and foes. Some demonologists have associated his name with the Egyptian god Amun or with the god Ba‘al Hammon of Carthage.\n\nAs Amaymon, also known as Amoymon or Amaimon, he is said to be a Prince of Hell who represents the sin of Wrath and King of either the West or East. Asmoday and sometimes Gaap are said to be his servants. A silver ring is required to be worn on the middle finger when summoning him, as his deadly breath will kill the summoner otherwise."

	"background":"Anat, also known as Anath, Anant, Anit, Anti, Anaitis, Anait, Anthat or Antit, is a western Semitic goddess of war and mistress of wild animals, also associated with love and sex. In mythical texts, she is famous for having a violent temperament and for taking joy in slaughter.\n\nIn the Baal Cycle texts, Anat appears as a war goddess, initially called upon by her father El alongside the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis to set the stage for the coronation of Yam; Anat, however, favors Baal, who is called her brother in this myth; outside Ugarit Hadad's sister was Hebat, however, and unlike Baal, Anat is not called Dagon's descendant in Ugaritic texts. After the defeat of the sea god she helps Baal secure the support of Asherah and threatens her father to let Baal build his own palace. She is later described ritually re-enacting a battle, and then purifying herself in her temple, where she receives a message from Baal asking her to establish peace on terms favorable to him. In response, she lists various past adversaries she vanquished to confirm she is a suitable goddess for this task. In the second half of the epic, she avenges her brother by killing Mot and with the help of the sun goddess, Shapash, brings Baal back from the land of the dead. This myth might represent the cycle of seasons, a single catastrophic drought, or perhaps simply another purely mythical conflict over divine kingship.\n\nIn the tale of Aqhat, Anat desires to obtain the legendary bow of the eponymous hero. After he rejects her various offers and taunts the goddess, stating that women have no business using such weapons, Anat, with her father's permission, devises a plan which culminates in his death and destruction of the bow.\n\nOther Ugaritic texts, especially apotropaic formulas, usually pair Anat with Astarte, who shared many of her functions, and is also often assumed to be Baal's wife by researchers. In the Baal cycle, they only appear together once, preventing Baal from attacking Ym's messengers. Sometimes, she was also associated with Resheph, a Canaanite god similar to the Mesopotamian plague deity Nergal. Like Anat, Resheph was known for his violent disposition.\n\nHer worship was introduced to Egypt, where she was also associated with Astarte, and was additionally considered the consort of the god Set, during the late bronze age conflated by the Egyptians with Baal Hadad and with Hittite weather gods. Her sexual aspects led her to be associated with Min, who is a god of male fertility. She was one of Rameses II's patron deities, who according to the pharaoh, watched over him in battle. He even named one of his daughters Bint-Anat, or \"Daughter of Anat\" in her honor.\n\nDuring the period of Babylonian exile, among the Hebrew inhabitants of the island of Elephantine, she was known as Anat-Yahu, the wife of Yahu (God). This association seemingly wasn't known in any other areas, and unlike fellow Canaanite deities Baal, Astarte and Asherah, Anat is not present in the Bible in any meaningful capacity, though \"Shamgar, son of Anath\" is a ruler mentioned in the Book of Judges."

In the old Vedic religion, they were simply gods of moral/social phenomenon who regularly competed with the Devas, who were gods of natural phenomenon.\n\nIn Hinduism, they are fanatical, demon-like entities associated with carnal and materialistic pleasures, and often thirsted for violence, opposed to the more peace-inclined Devas. There are many kings and rulers of the Asura, but one major Asura Lord is based on Virocana, also known as Maha Vairocana or Dainichi Nyorai, the king of the asuras who, alongside Indra, searched for the secret of enlightenment.\n\nIn Buddhism, they are the lowest rank of deities and are jealous gods addicted to various malign passions, while said to be one of the four unhappy births, being representative of a human being incapable of peace and always angered with the world, while also seeking strife and violence. In Japanese Buddhism, they are demigods, or semi-blessed beings. Powerful protectors of Buddhism, yet fierce and quarrelsome, they are partly good and partly evil, like humans. Their realm is believed to be a world of strife said to be located on the ocean floor. Some say Ashura was an Indian royal who converted to Buddhism. In other traditions, Ashura was a sun goddess who was feared for bringing droughts. The leaders of the Asuras were called Asurinda or Asurendra (\"Asura Lord\"). The principal leaders are Vemacritin (also called Vepacitti), Rahu (also called Veroca, Verocana, or Virocana) and Paharada. The appearance of the Megami Tensei series' Asura is most likely based on the Japanese Buddhist depiction of the Asuras.\n\nHowever, in Zoroastrianism, Asura is known as Ahura, and are depicted as the forces of good, led by Ahura Mazda. In fact, the Indo-Iranians, the term asura (or in this case ahura) originally referred to divine beings on par with the gods. After the Aryans went their separate ways from the Iranians, the asuras came to be seen as rival gods, eventually even demonic. The struggle between the devas and the asuras possibly reflects the conflict between the tribes who worshiped a pantheon led by the god Indra and the tribes who worshiped the gods called the asuras."

The black color of the third horse symbolized death and famine, bearing a scale of famine. The rider rides onward, denying the world life-sustaining food and bringing starvation, but being ordered by divine law to not harm oil or wine. The rider is shown holding a scale, which represents scarcity of food, higher prices and famine, likely as a result of the wars caused by the red horseman. Food will be scarce, but luxuries such as wine and oil will still be readily available.\n\nThe \"a measure of wheat for a penny\" from the King James Version of the Bible might not sound like a famine to modern ears, but in the NIV we read \"a quart of wheat for a day's wages,\" which is a little clearer. While it's never identified as his own, it is implied that the voice John the Apostle hears coming from \"the third of the four living creatures\" comes from the Black Rider, making it the only horseman that actually vocalizes his intentions, the aforementioned raise in prices."

She arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine and a disorderly, ecstatic following. She was unique among deities worshiped by the Greeks as she had a transgendered, or eunuch, priesthood. Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine, castrated, Phrygian shepherd-consort known as Attis. She is associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature and wild animals, namely lions.\n\nIn Rome she was known as Magna Mater, meaning Great Mother. They would reinvent her as a Trojan goddess, which made her a goddess ancestor of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas. With Rome's eventual dominance over the Mediterranean, a Roman version of Cybele's cult would spread throughout the entire empire."

He is said to be a calm and gentle deity, as he helps humans in need and, due to their sleep, owns half of their lives. Hypnos is often depicted as a young man wrapped in poppy stock, a horn in his hand, and sometimes wings on his head.\n\nHe lives in a cave with the entrance dotted by narcotic flowers which appears in the Greek underworld, specifically Erebos, a wall that surrounds it. According to some stories, Hypnos lives instead in a big cave, which the river Lethe comes from and where night and day meet. His bed is made of ebony, on the entrance of the cave grow a number of poppies and other hypnotic plants. No light and no sound would ever enter his grotto.\n\nAccording to Homer, he lives on the island Lemnos, which later on has been claimed to be his very own dream-island. His children had sometimes been claimed as the Oneiroi (Morpheus, Phobetor and Phantasos), the gods of dreams along with his wife being Pasithea. In some other depictions, the Oneiroi are the younger children of Nyx and Erebus which makes them Hypnos' younger siblings."

	"origin":"Mesopotamian Mythology\nBabylonian Mythology",
	"background":"Ishtar is the Akkadian (and thus later Babylonian and Assyrian) equivalent of the Sumerian goddess Inanna and shares her roles as a goddess of love, war and fertility. Like Inanna, she wasn't considered a mother goddess, and few, if any, texts name any gods as her children. She is known as the \"Queen of Heaven\" and is the personification of the morning star (Venus). Her father is usuaully said to be Sin, the moon god, and she forms an astral trinity with him and her twin brother Shamash, the sun god. Other texts sometimes refer to Anu, Enlil or Ea (Enki) as her father. She is also known as the \"Lady of Battles\" because of her violent and warlike character. Her holy city was Uruk (or Erech). Part of her cult was thought to be devoted to temple prostitution, though despite Ishtar's sexual character, some modern researchers question this claim or the scope of such practices. Her symbols were the eight pointed star (originally simply a Mesopotamian symbol of heaven, but in later times only of the morning star), the lion and the dove. Like most Mesopotamian gods, art often depicts her wearing a horned crown, a symbol of divinity. She was commonly depicted as winged.\n\nAccording to one of her most prominent myths, Ishtar's sister is Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld. When Ishtar descended to the netherworld, Ereshkihgal cursed her, trapping her among the dead. With Ishtar dead, the earth withered and would not produce, and neither animals nor human beings would bear young. With great effort, the water god Ea used magic to revive Ishtar, which displeased Ereshkigal. She demanded to trade her sister for someone else, finally deciding that Ishtar's husband Tammuz would replace her.\n\nThe epic of Gilgamesh states she had many lovers, but all were fated to be killed or turned into animals at her hands (Tammuz is described as turned into a bird with a broken wing rather than imprisoned in Ereshkigal's realm). When Gilgamesh had rejected her advances, she sent the Bull of Heaven, a sacred beast of the god Anu, to combat him. After he managed to vanquish the bull with the help of his companion, the wild man Enkidu, the gods decided to kill the latter to punish the pair for this transgression.\n\nThe historical King Sargon of Akkad was closely assciated with Ishtar. According to an epic poem about Sargon's exploits, she guided him to victory against his enemies, lead by the tyrannical ruler Nur-Dagan of Purushanda, who was advised by Enlil. Later Assyrian legends claim Sargon was born as an illegitimate son of a priestess and worked as a gardener before Ishtar decided to bestow kingship upon him. In his documents, Sargon frequently attributed his successes to Inanna/Ishtar, and his daughter Enheduanna wrote many hymns to this goddess.\n\nDue to Ishtar's popularity, many cultures in contact with Mesopotamia either adopted her into their pantheons or conflated her with their local goddesses. The Canaanite goddess Astarte was her western counterpart, while Hittites and Hurrians sometimes used Ishtar's name to refer to their own war goddess, Shaushka."

Isis was said to have blackmailed the true name of Ra the supreme sun god out of him, by making a snake poison him, which could only be cured by Isis herself. (Ra, being a god, cannot die from the poison, but the pain would still last.) In later myths about Isis, she had a brother, Osiris, who became her husband, and she then was said to have conceived Horus. Isis was instrumental in the resurrection of Osiris when he was murdered by Seth. Her magical skills restored his body to life after she gathered the body parts that had been strewn about the earth by Set."

Despite her negative connotations, she is today considered the goddess of time and change. Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. More complex Tantric beliefs sometimes extend her role so far as to be the \"ultimate reality\" or Brahman. She is also revered as Bhavatarini (literally \"redeemer of the universe\"). Comparatively recent devotional movements largely conceive Kali as a benevolent mother goddess.\n\nKali is represented as the consort of god Shiva, on whose body she is often seen standing. She is associated with many other Hindu goddesses like Durga, Bhadrakali, Sati, Rudrani, Parvati and Chamunda. She is the foremost among the Dasa-Mahavidyas, ten fierce Tantric goddesses. Her sacred place is Calcutta, where she still retains many followers who worship her as a mother goddess.\n\nKali is a fierce aspect of Durga who is an aspect of Parvati.

Feeling grateful, Chyavana told them of a feast hosted by Indra, where the gods would drink the life elixir soma to retain their immortality. Apparently Indra did not allow the twin deities to enter as they had dabbled with mortals for too long.\n\nSaddened, they reported this to the sage, who decided to offer sacrifices to the twin deities to signify their godhood. This infuriated Indra, who attacked the sage with thunderbolts and mountains. Chyavana countered by summoning Mada, who was so enormous that its two sets of jaws could swallow the earth and heavens at the same time. Indra, worried that the gods are still in the heavens, surrendered and allowed the Asvin twins to join the feast."

Because of this she is honored as the mother of God (theotokos in greek) by Christians and as the greatest of all women in Islam.\n\nCatholicism is the branch of Christianity and the Abrahamic faiths that focuses the most on Maria, where she is said to have inspired Jesus' first miracle at the marriage at Cana, and later bore witness to his death on the cross and resurrection three days later, she also received the holy spirit in the form of a flame during the Pentecost and became a leading figure among Jesus' apostles.\n\nCatholics believe that Maria didn't die, but rather ascended directly to Heaven at the end of her life, where she became the Regina Coeli queen of the heavens, ruler of all saints and angels and main intermediary between God and humanity.\n\nDespite her important role, she isn't worshiped as a goddess, but rather honored as a great saint, and many today claim to have received miracles and visions from her.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, the three books by Dante Alighieri that depicts the Catholic view of the afterlife in the middle ages, and a great inspiration for the Megami Tensei franchise, she is said to reside in the Candida Rosa (italian for \"white rose\") a realm within the highest sphere of Heaven, the Primum Mobile, from where she intervenes to save Dante Alighieri's soul, allowing him to travel through the three realms of the afterlife.\n\nIn some Apocryphal texts, she is said to have been protected by the archangel Aniel."

She manifests, perpetuates and governs all forms of illusion as well as the dream of duality in the universe and the mystic arts. By extension, it later came to mean the powerful force that creates the cosmic illusion that the phenomenal world is real.\n\nShe brings to mankind the ignorance and enlightenment of the individualism, the concept of ownership and the awareness of otherworldly phenomena. For the Nondualists, maya is thus that cosmic force that presents the infinite Brahman (the supreme being) as the finite phenomenal world. Maya is reflected on the individual level by human ignorance (Ajnana) of the real nature of the self, which is mistaken for the empirical ego but which is in reality identical with Brahman.\n\nIt is believed by some schools of thought that the Burmese mother goddess Maya also holds some connection to the Hindu goddess of illusion. She has also been known as an epithet for goddess, and the name of a manifestation of Lakshmi, the goddess of \"wealth, prosperity and love.\" She was also known as Mother Maya, Mother of Illusions and Maya of the Night."

It is said that in 1583, Johann Weyer considers both of them to be the same demon. He claimed:\n\n\"Naberius [Naberus], alias Cerberus, is a valiant marquesse, shewing himselfe in the forme of a crowe, when he speaketh with a hoarse voice: he maketh a man amiable and cunning in all arts, and speciallie in rhetorike, he procureth the losse of prelacies and dignities: nineteene legions heare (and obeie) him.\"\nThe Grand Grimoire regards Nebiros as the field marshal and inspector general of the armies of Hell along with being one of the Six Great Officers. He can be conjured to inflict woes upon anyone, discover the Hand of Glory, teach the mystic and occult qualities of all animals, plants and minerals and supply necromantic advice. One of the three Goetic nobles under his direct authority is Naberius, suggesting that the Grand Grimoires author understood the two spellings to signify distinct demons.

Although demons are usually spoken of in abstract terms, and more often described by their evil influences only, they are depicted as ugly and grotesque creatures of hell-fire. Shaytan is also used as a name/term by Muslims to call Iblis, after his falling with Allah which resulted when he didn't bow down to Adam like the other angels.\n\nThey live among human beings or Jinn, for these two beings alone have been bestowed a \"free will\" to choose between obedience and disobedience of their lord among all his creations. They incite both with evil suggestions and tempt them into sin. All those among the Jinns and the human beings who follow the mission of disobedience of Iblis, the first Shaytan are all termed Shayateen too, since they follow their evil will.\n\nShayateen are \"whisperers\" who speak into the hearts of men and women alike to push them into doing sinful deeds and straying off the righteous path. This, and the Nafs \"self which is inclined to evil\" are the sources where the desire to sin comes from, according to Islam. There is a supplication in the Qu'ran which is aimed to fight off these temptations.\n\nThe word Šayṭān originates from the Semitic root š-ṭ-n (\"distant, astray\") taking a theological connotation designating a creature distant from divine mercy. In pre-Islamic Arabia, this term was used to designate an evil spirit, but only used by poets who were in contact with Jews and Christians. With the emergence of Islam, the meaning of shayatin moved closer to the Christian concept of devils. The term shayatin appears in a similar way in the Book of Enoch, denoting the hosts of the devil. Taken from Islamic sources, \"shaitan\" may be translated as \"demon\" or \"devil.\" Among Muslim authors, the term can also apply to evil supernatural entities in general, such as evil jinn, fallen angels or Tawaghit. In a broader sense, the term is used to designate everything from an ontological perspective that is a manifestation of evil."

He did not play a major part in Greek mythology and rarely appeared in any stories, as he was mostly displaced by Hades, the god of the underworld.\n\nIn the Greek poem, Theogony, Thanatos (Greek: θάνατος, Death) is one of the sons of Nyx and Erebus and is the elder twin brother of Hypnos. In the earliest mythological accounts, Thanatos is the harbinger of peaceful death, bringing eternal sleep to the world. Characterized as indiscriminate and merciless, Thanatos is detested by all and he hates them in return, all too happy to bring mortals to their fated end. Thanatos is perceived by Greek poets as a fearsome, sword-wielding, shaggy bearded specter and fierce of countenance. He is a harbinger of suffering and grief, and his coming was marked by pain.\n\nIn later eras, Thanatos is portrayed again as an angel of death, associated more with a gentle passing than a woeful demise, guiding mortals after their death. Many Roman sarcophagi depict him as a winged boy, very much akin to Eros. His Roman counterpart is Mors, who was known through his later gentler depiction."

In the Babylonian creation myth, Enuma Elish, she is described as the mother of many of the monsters featured in Mesopotamian mythology, including dragons, scorpion men and bull men. There are no known depictions of Tiamat, but it is generally agreed she was envisioned as a monstrous serpent or dragon. She is rarely mentioned in sources other than copies of the Enuma Elish narrative, and wasn't an object of religious cult.\n\nTiamat and her mate Apsu, the personification of the underground freshwater ocean, were described the ancestors of the entire Babylonian pantheon. However, Apsu wanted to exterminate his children, which lead first to a conflict between him and the god Ea (Babylonian counterpart of Enki), from which the latter emerged victorious, and then to the central event of the myth, Tiamat's battle with Ea's son Marduk.\n\nWhile Marduk's battle with Tiamat is sometimes incorrectly viewed as the most ancient version of the Chaoskampf narrative (the battle between a god or hero and a chthonic or aquatic monster, usually a serpent), it was most likely only compiled during the reign of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon, and as such was probably influenced by the earlier tales of Hadad's battle with Ym, Set's with Apep or Teshub's with Illuyanka, Hedammu and Ullikummi."

It is also said that Indra tricked the asuras into holding Vasuki by its heads, so that they could inhale its hot breath. However, as the milk ocean was churned up, a poison seeped out which threatened the world. So Shiva swallowed the venom as an act of self-sacrifice to prevent premature destruction of the world, thus earning him the title of Nilakantha (\"blue throat\"). He has a sister called Manasa, who is a goddess of snakes and poison.\n\nVasuki is also recorded in Buddhist mythology, as well as the mythology of China and Japan, as one of the \"Eight Great Naga Kings\" (known in Japan as the Hachi Ryuu-Ou). In Buddhist mythology, he, along with the other Naga kings, appear in the audience of many of the Buddha's sermons."

They are a diverse tradition of mountain ascetic practices associated with Shinto beliefs, Taoism, magic, supernatural powers and Esoteric (Tantric) Buddhism. After the arrival of Buddhism to Japan in the mid-6th century, the native Shinto Kami were soon considered manifestations of the imported Buddhist divinities. Zao serves as the protector deity of sacred Mt. Kimpusen Japan's Nara prefecture and is considered the local Japanese Shinto manifestation of three Buddhist divinities: the Historical Buddha, Kannon Bodhisattva and Miroku Buddha, who serve respectively as the Buddhas of the Past, Present and Future. This makes Zaou perhaps the most powerful local divinity of religious mountain worship in Japan.\n\nZaou is widely venerated in the entire mountain range stretching from Yoshino to Kumano (the cradle of Shugendou practice), but also venerated at numerous remote mountain shrines and temples throughout the country. Despite Zaou's Tantric appearance, the deity is generally thought to be of Japanese origin. Zaou's cult spread throughout Japan from the 11th century onward.\n\nZao Gongen appears in some cultural content of Japan, mostly classical, such as Kuze Noh, where the gods protect Emperor Temmu, 40th Emperor of Japan, against enemy soldiers pursuing him."

Abaddon has also been identified as the \"angel\" of death and destruction, demon of the abyss, and chief of demons of the underworld hierarchy, where he is equated with Samael or Satan. In demonology, he is said to tempt people with sloth and discord.\n\nAbaddon/Apollyon is the chief of the demons of the seventh hierarchy, the king of the grasshoppers, or demon locusts (described as having the bodies of winged war-horses, the faces of humans, and the poisonous curved tails of scorpions). In occultism and esoterism, Abaddon is related to blood red, brown and green colors, winter, the month of January, Saturday, intuition, sacrifice and challenge, the ruby and the sword.\n\nAbaddon was originally a biblical term in Hebrew which means \"place of destruction\" and is a fiery plain in the realm of the dead, Gehenna.

Her sacred animals were lions and gazelles.\n\nThe Nabateans regarded Alilat as a mother goddess, but also conflated her with the Greek Athena and her Roman counterpart Minerva, despite Alilat seemingly lacking any warlike traits herself. She was either the mother or wife of the popular Nabatean god Dushara, considered to be the equivalent of either Zeus or Dionysus.\n\nAl-Lat is mosty known as one of three main idols (alongside al-'Uzza and al-Manat) worshiped by the people of Mecca before Islam was spread by the prophet Muhammad. Her idol was seemingly a baetylus (omphalos), an unusual stone. Such a form of cult was also associated with Alilat among the Nabateans.\n\nMedieval Arabic legends considered the stone idol described in earlier texts to be a deification of a man who used a stone to grind cereal for the pilgrims visiting pre-Islamic Mecca, assuming the name's original form to be al-latt, \"the grinder.\""

She was treated as the most sacred of all Shinto deities and is said to be a direct ancestor of the Japanese Imperial dynasty. Her name, Amaterasu, means \"(that which) illuminates Heaven\" or \"she who illuminates the heavens.\" When her father, Izanagi, escaped from his visit to Yomi, he had to perform a cleansing ritual in the river Woto and it was then, from the god’s left eye, that Amaterasu was born. She is also the sister of the storm god Susano-o and the moon god Tsukuyomi. Amaterasu constantly quarreled with her mischievous younger brother Susano-o and finally having enough, Izanagi temporarily exiled him from heaven.\n\nThe most famous myth involving her took place when her brother Susano-o attacked her temple in a drunken rage and killed several of her priestesses. Distressed by this, Amaterasu fled into a cave and darkness fell on the world. Ultimately, the other gods lured her out of her hiding place by placing a mirror next to the cave entrance and began to cheer and yell due to the antics of Ame no Uzume. When Amaterasu peeked out to see what the commotion was, she was told there was a new god and was directed to look at the mirror. Having never seen her own reflection before, she was fascinated by what she saw and was lured out of the cave, returning light to the world. Amaterasu is also known as the ancestor of the Imperial lineage.\uFEFF\n\nIn Kojiki, her name is unified to be \"Amaterasu-Omikami\" (天照大御神). In Nihon Shoki, she is more often addressed by her full title of \"Amaterasu-Sume-Okami\" (天照皇大神), or alternatively \"Sume-Omikami\" (皇大御神), which literally means the \"Great Imperial Deity.\" In the medieval period, Amaterasu was often called \"Tenshô Daijin,\" its on'yomi reading. She has also been known as the The Shining Light, The Blinding Radiance, The Great August Kami Who Shines in the Heavens and The Honorable Goddess of the Great Sun."

In turn, Amaterasu became terrified of his wrath and retreated into a cave.

They considered this so comical that they laughed heartily at the sight.\n\nAmaterasu heard them, and peered out to see what all the fuss was about. When she opened the cave, she saw her glorious reflection in a mirror which Uzume had placed on a tree, and slowly emerged from her hiding spot.\n\nAt that moment, the god Ame-no-Tajikarawo dashed forth and closed the cave behind her, refusing to budge so that she could no longer retreat. Another god tied a magic rope across the entrance. The deities Ame-no-Koyane and Ame-no-Futodama then asked Amaterasu to rejoin the divine. She agreed, and light was restored to the earth."

The supreme god Anu promised sovereignty over the gods to whoever recovered the tablets from Anzu. Due to the surviving texts being in fragments, it's unclear to establish the outcome, but it seems Ninurta, Enlil's son, recovered the Tablets. In at least some accounts he was tricked by Enki afterwards, which seemingly prevented him from becoming the ruler of the gods. In some versions, Ninurta's deeds were instead ascribed to Marduk.\n\nThe myth Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the nether world mentions Anzu as one of the monsters infesting a tree planted by Inanna. She enlists the aid of the eponymous heroes to get rid of it.\n\nA more benign version of Anzu appears in a myth about Gilgamesh's father, Lugalbanda.

Ceremonial burials of bulls indicate that ritual sacrifice was part of the worship of the early cow deities and a bull might represent a king who became a deity after death.

In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship.\n\nThe Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, \"overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering.\" His twin sons Phobos and Deimos and his lover, or sister, Enyo accompanied him on his war chariot. In the Iliad, his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him.\n\nAres was most often characterized as a coward in spite of his connection to war; he responded to even the slightest injury with outrage. He is well known as the lover of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, who was married to Hephaestus, god of craftsmanship.\n\nAres' main attribute was a peaked warrior's helm. Even in domestic scenes, such as feasts of the gods, he was depicted either wearing or holding his helm. An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality. Ares also had numerous mortal (or divine) offspring. Many of these inherited their father's violent temperament and in myth were often cast in the role of villains. In one myth, he created the Amazons.\n\nAres is also the counterpart of the Roman god, Mars. Ares, like Mars and Nergal, is a deity associated with the planet Mars."

	"background":"Asherah, also known as Athirat, Ashratum and Ashertu, is a Semitic goddess, particularly important in Ugarit, where she was the wife of the chief god El. Elsewhere she is also attested as the wife of the \"Lord of the Mountains,\" Amurru (Martu in Sumerian). It's possible El and Amurru were one and the same, as in Mesopotamian sources the latter was viewed as the lead god of the Amorites, nomads living to the west of Sumer and Akkad and ancestors of later inhabitants of cities like Ugarit.[1]\n\nIn Ugarit, as El's wife, she was regarded as a mother goddess, and thus the mother of many if not all of the gods.[2] References to Asherah as a \"mother goddess\" need to be understood as presenting her as a divine queen mother, rather than a \"mother nature\" or fertility goddess, however. The Baal cycle of myths mentions the existence of \"seventy sons of Asherah,\" the most prominent among them seeming to be Ashtar. Ugaritic texts frequently describe her as \"Lady Asherah of the Sea\" and address with a title likely meaning \"great lady\" or \"queen mother.\" The Ugaritic tale of King Keret describes her as the main goddess of the cities of Sidon and Tyre, though as it's likely a satirical text, it's uncertain if she was actually a major goddess there. She isn't attested in later Phoenician inscriptions from the same cities. Unlike other Canaanite goddesses, she wasn't popular in Egypt. No known piece of art has been identified with certainity as a depiction of Asherah.[3] Because of this her attributes remain uncertain, though one possible clue about them is the fact that in the Baal cycle she is described as a weaver. No animal symbol is credibly attributed to her.[4]\n\nIn Babylonia, she was known under the name Ashratum and was described as \"the merciful,\" a common title applied also to Nergal, Ishtar, Marduk, Ninurta and Sin. She didn't play a major role there, much like her husband Amurru, and appears in only one Babylonian myth, which describes their marriage. She's called a daughter in law of Anu (the sky god) in it. To date no known reference to Asherah from Mesopotamia presents her as a fertility goddess. Theophoric names indicate she was already known to Babylonians in Hammurabi's times.\n\nIn Arabia, she was regarded as the wife of a few local gods in the southern kingdoms. However, references to her from this part of the world are relatively rare and rather late (5th century BC).\n\nAsherah is often confused with, but not the same as Astarte, the western counterpart of Ishtar. They appear with distinct names (Athirat and Ashtart, respectively; one name starts with an aleph, the other with an ayin), functions and attributes in Ugaritic texts, the earliest known source of information about Canaanite myths and beliefs. Ashtart, described as a warrior and hunter similar to Anat (and in most texts paired with her, but never with Athirat), is one of Baal's allies, assisting him in the battle against Yam.[5] Meanwhile, the mother goddess Athirat, seemingly associated with the sea, supports Ashtar's claim to the throne instead, and possibly even celebrates Baal's death at the hands of Mot. A Hittite text often assumed to be a translation of an Ugaritic one additionally presents a story in which \"Ishtar\" (Ashtart or Anat) warns Baal of a plot against him prepared by Elkunirsa (El) and Ashertu (Asherah). Asherah and Astarte are also described separately in the Bible, where it's usually Astarte, or rather Astaroth, who is associated with Baal; exceptions from this rule are likely the result of memories of Canaanite reigion gradually fading away, rather than proof of Asherah and Astarte being conflated, or of an otherwise unknown tradition where Asherah was Baal's consort.\n\nWhile some Bible scholars assume she is the goddess referred to as the \"Queen of Heaven\" whose worship was condemned by the prophet Jeremiah, this title is usually associated with Ishtar, an unrelated goddess (or with her Canaanite equivalent Astarte), and Asherah seems to lack any astral roles herself. Other biblical references to Asherah as well as some archaeological finds might indicate she was worshiped by some inhabitants of the kingdoms of Judah and Samaria in their early history, perhaps even in a role similar to that in Ugarit (eg. as the main local god's spouse) but the scope of this cult is unclear, and the Bible often seems to use the term \"asherah\" to refer to sanctuaries and prohibited cult objects (much like the biblical usage of \"Baal\" often refers to idols kept in temples) rather than to a specific well defined goddess.[6] Despite the frequent references to these \"asherahs\" being wooden objects or perhaps sacred trees, it is unclear if Asherah as a goddess was ever associated with any plants.[7]"

Her Roman equivalent was Morta. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she and her sisters (Lachesis and Clotho) are the daughters of Nyx and Erebus. In other accounts, they are said to be the daughters of Zeus and Themis as well as several other beings such as Chaos and Ananke.\n\nAtropos , along with her sisters and Hermes, was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people, forced the goddess Aphrodite into making love with other beings, weakened the monster Typhon with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with lightning, and even aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Even though Atropos and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology.\n\nShe is the most known sister, due to her job. Atropos was the smallest in stature, but the eldest and as some believe, the most powerful and cruel. Once those ends are cut by her razor sharp scissors, it is impossible to tie them back together.

He gained this power as a child when watching his father's druids preparing poisonous spells, the fumes of which rose into his eye. His eye was normally kept closed, only to be opened on the battlefield by four men using a handle fitted to his eyelid, or, in some versions, a system of ropes and pulleys.\n\nAccording to prophecy, Balor was to be killed by his grandson. To avoid his fate, he locked his daughter, Ethlinn, in a tower made of crystal to keep her from becoming pregnant. However, Cian, one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, with the help of the druidess Birog, managed to enter the tower. She gave birth to triplets by him, but Balor threw them into the ocean. Birog saved one, Lugh, and gave him to Manannan mac Lir, who became his foster father. He was called Lugh Lamhfada and became a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Lugh led the Tuatha in the second Battle of Magh Tuiredh against the Fomorians. Ogma disarmed Balor during this battle, but Balor killed Nuada with his eye. Lugh shot a sling-stone which drove Balor's eye out the back of his head, where it continued to wreak its deadly power on the Fomorian army. In other versions Lugh blinded Balor with a spear made by Goibniu, or decapitated him and used his eye against the Fomorians."

It often has avian characteristics; this attribute, as well as its purported method of killing (turning prey to stone), often conflates it with the cockatrice.\n\nThe only way folklore said that a basilisk could be harmed or driven away was via the odor of a weasel, presumably due to the fact weasels are natural predators of lizards and snakes (especially the mongoose)."

Some believe them to be an order or class of angels; others hold them to be a class of heavenly beings higher than angels.\n\nThe biblical prophet Ezekiel describes the cherubim as a tetrad of living creatures, each having four faces: of a lion, an ox, an eagle and a man. They are said to have the stature and hands of a man, the feet of a calf and four eye covered wings. Two of the wings extended upward, meeting above and sustaining the throne of God; while the other two stretched downward and covered the creatures themselves. Scholars have suggested that the Cherub originated from the Babylonian colossi \"shedu;\" which also go by the name of lamassu, protective gatekeepers who appear in the form of human-headed winged bulls, although there is no etymological evidence to suggest this.\n\nCherubim represent the four domains created by God: wild animals (lion), domestic animals (ox), humans (man) and birds (eagle). Further to this, each represents the chief of their respective domains. The lion, known as \"King of the Jungle,\" chief of wild animals and unmatched in courage; the ox, chief of domestic animals with its dignified strength; the eagle, most majestic of all flying creatures, far seeing and swift; mankind, chief of all creations, is a chief of chiefs and so represents a king of kings, made in YHVH's image and so possesses love and free will. \n\nCourage in pursuit of Justice (Lion)\nTremendous Power (Ox)\nLove out of freewill (Man)\nFar-sighted Wisdom (Eagle)\nThey may also be representative of certain other traits i.e. the lion of royalty, kingship or ruling, the calf or ox of serving or sacrificing for others, the man of humanity and the eagle of majesty or divinity."

The churel usually lives near small rivers or springs. She is either seen wearing a white or a red sari, representing a widow or a bride respectively. Along with this there's also a group of people telling that a churel is a spirit with enormous power who has sacrificed herself by giving her back part of meat in some ceremony of getting powers through black magic and that they can not be sometimes be found at the place of their death too."

This power enabled her not only to choose who was born, but also to decide when gods or mortals were to be saved or put to death.\n\nClotho and her sisters (Atropos and Lachesis) were the daughters of Erebus and Nyx, though later they are said to have been born of Zeus and Themis. Clotho is also mentioned in the tenth book of the Republic of Plato as the daughter of Necessity. Her Roman equivalent is Nona.\n\nAs one of the three fates her impact on Greek mythology was significant. Clotho, along with her sisters and Hermes, was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people, forced the goddess Aphrodite into making love with other beings, weakened the monster Typhon with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with lightning, and even aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Even though Clotho and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology.\n\nClotho also possess her life-giving powers in the myth of Tantalus, as shown when she brought Pelops, Tantalus' son, back to life, with the exception of his eaten shoulder, which was replaced by a chunk of ivory."

The son of the god Lugh and Deichtine (sister to the current king of Ulster), he was originally named Setanta, but gained his better-known name as a child after he killed Culann's fierce guard-dog in self-defense, and offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. Cu Chulainn trained in war under the goddess Scathach, who lives in the Land of Shadows, and earned the magic spear Gae Bolg. At the age of seventeen, he defended Ulster single handedly against the armies of Queen Mab of Connacht in the epic Tain Bo Cuailnge. It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but that his life would be short; one reason he is compared to the Greek hero Achilles. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, in which he becomes an unrecognizable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Laeg, and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.\n\nMany say he acquired a lot of power by submitting himself to some geis, two of which are \"I'll never eat dog meat\" and \"I'll never refuse a meal offered by a woman.\" But then a woman offered him some dog meat, as so he had to choose what geis to break and he accepted the meal. After that, he was forced by Mab to break his geis one by one, as so he met his death at the hands of Lugaid (child of Cu Roi, a man he had to kill to defend Ulster). He once spurned the goddess Morrigan and was cursed to die by being pierced on his own spear. Afterwards, Morrigan took him to the land of the fae, where he became a knight."

Though it is commonly depicted as willfully ignorant of the spiritual universe, the Demiurge itself and the material it uses to create and fashion the universe are considered uncreated and eternal or copies of the product of another being, depending on the system. In some of these systems, it and the rest of the material universe will be sent to Hell, where it will become the judge and torturer of the damned. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\n\nIn the arch-dualist ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is malevolent, as it is linked to the material world. In others, the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\n\nHe was known by different Gnostic teachings as Samael, Saklas, \"Fool\" or Yaldabaoth, \"Son of Chaos.\" Gnosticism portrays Yaldabaoth as an inferior \"evil\" god who created the world who appears as the \"God\" of the Old Testament. He is said to have been the devil, but most sects consider them to be two completely different entities.\n\nIn most schools of Gnosticism, Yaldabaoth (the name for this demiurge), also known as the Leonine Serpent, was created by Sophia, the lowest of the aeons who dwelled in the Divine stone of the Pleroma. She was exiled from the Pleroma for her desire to create something outside of the Divine Totality, but could only form a monstrosity of imperfections, an abortion full of pride and malevolence. When she created the Demiurge, she was ashamed by it; to hide her folly from the Pleroma, she created a great cloud around him and built him a throne. With no awareness of the Pleroma or the Monad, from which all things were derived, the Demiurge concluded it was the creator of all things.\n\nIn an attempt to create order from the perceived chaos of the cosmos, Yaldabaoth chained the soul and heart in mortal forms and punishes those who refuse to adhere to his rule. In ancient times, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven archons, whose names are given, but their chief, known as Yaldabaoth comes into still greater prominence. The Demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself.\n\nIt then fashioned the material universe in an unconscious imitation of the Pleroma, and made the first human in the image of the true first man, Adam. Though it could not grant him a soul (having no awareness of the Pleroma) Sophia pitied it and granted him a divine spark that gave him life. The Demiurge was infuriated when Adam thanked the true God for his existence instead of him and sought to ensnare him in the material world through Eve; however, Sophia sent the serpent (sometimes depicted as Satanael or Sophia herself) to tempt Eve, granting her and Adam the secret knowledge of their spiritual nature. The Demiurge expelled them from Eden when he learned of this, and has since sought to keep the souls of mankind bound to the material world.\n\nSome schools of Gnosticism say that one angel had found out that he was a fake and betrayed him, giving humanity the gift of free-will. This fallen angel was known as Satanael who became Yaldabaoth's own opposite and enemy."

In addition to wine-making, he is the patron deity of agriculture and the theater. Hailed as an Asiatic foreigner, he was thought to have had strong ties to the East and to Ethiopia in the South. He was also known as the Liberator, freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy or wine. The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of the aulos and to bring an end to care and worry. Scholars have discussed Dionysus' relationship to the \"cult of the souls\" and his ability to preside over communication between the living and the dead.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Dionysus is made out to be a son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. He is described as being womanly or \"man-womanish.\" The retinue of Dionysus was called the thiasus and was chiefly comprised of maenads and satyrs. Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites. One of the most famous mystery religions was the Eleuinian Mysteries, in which Dionysus may have had a minor role. In the Thracian Mysteries, he wears the bassaris or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. His own rites, the Dionysian Mysteries, practiced by maenads ad others, were the most secret of all. Many scholars believe that Dionysus is a syncretism of a local Greek nature deity and a more powerful god from Thrace or Phrygia such as Sabazios or Zalmoxis."

It usually has magical talents, often involving metallurgy.\n\nThe original concept of dwarves is very difficult to determine. The sources closest to the original Germanic mythology come from Norse Mythology, but even these are scarce and varied. Sources have gradually given dwarves more comical and superstitious roles. Dwarves were certainly humanoid, but sources differ over their height, their lifestyles, and their similarity to elves. Considering early sources, and considering the dwarves' nature, original dwarves seem fully human height. They had strong associations with death: paled skin; dark hair; connections with the earth; their role in mythology. They followed animistic traditions, showing similarities to such concepts of the dead.\n\nAs their mythology evolved, the most notable changes have had them become more comical and more mysterious. They adopted the modern image of short height and ugliness. Their associations with the underground became more predominant. Dwarves were magical creatures with huge skill at metallurgy, taking fame for making great artifacts of legend. Late Norse concepts of dwarves became quite different from the early ones. The Legendary saga shows the new trend. The remnants of the original dwarf formed later fairy tales and folklore. They had become unseen magical creatures like fairies; users of charms, curses, and deceit.\n\nModern fantasy and literature have formed an intriguing web of concepts, from that of the original dwarf, to the dwarf of later Norse mythology, the dwarf of folk-tales, and of other mythology. The typical modern dwarf has distinctive features such as short stature, excessive hair, and skill at mining and metallurgy."

In antiquity, she was also known as Automatia.\n\nThis goddess, unlike others, didn't disappear from culture when Christianity settled in Europe, and she was often referred to depicted in poetry and painting, being called Lady Fortune. She is also one of the entities that can be seen in the Wheel of Fortune tarot card."

He is the son of Shiva and Parvati and depicted as having the head of an elephant (often with one broken tusk), a pot-belly and anywhere from two to six arms.\n\nThere are several popular Hindu stories as to Ganesha's origins and how he got his elephant head. While some say Ganesha was born with the head of an elephant, most say it was replaced by Shiva. In one story Parvati placed Ganesha as the guard to her bathhouse to which he agreed. When Shiva came and wished to see his wife, Ganesha refused, which infuriated Shiva. The two battled until Shiva in his anger cut off Ganesha's head. When Parvati saw what Shiva had done, he apologized and hastily searched for a new head. He took the first head he saw, which was that of an elephant, and placed it on Ganesha's shoulders. In some versions of this story, Ganesha already had an elephant's head, and it was at this point that Shiva threw his trident and broke off one of his tusks.\n\nIn another story, Parvati was so proud of her newborn son that she invited all the other devas to a feast so that they may see how perfect and handsome he was. Among the guests was Parvati's brother Shani, who was cursed with the evil eye. When he looked upon Ganesha his head was instantly burned to ashes. Luckily Brahma was present and agreed that he would allow Ganesha to live if the head of the first creature that was found was placed on his shoulders. Vishnu sent out Garuda to search for a head, and he returned with the head of an elephant. The head was placed on Ganesha's shoulders, and he was allowed to live again."

Garuda is depicted as having a golden body, white face, red wings and an eagle's beak, but with a strong man's body. He wears a crown on his head. He is an ancient powerful creature in the epics, whose wing flapping can stop the spinning of heaven, earth and underworld, as well as large enough to block out the sun. The Shatapatha Brahmana mentions Garuda as the personification of courage. In the Mahabharata, Garutman is stated to be same as Garuda, then described as the one who is fast, who can shapeshift into any form and enter anywhere.\n\nIn Buddhist mythology, the garudas, also referred to as the garula, are enormous predatory birds with intelligence and social organization. They are described as beings with intelligence and social organization. They are also sometimes known as suparṇa (Sanskrit; Pāli: supaṇṇa), meaning \"well-winged, having good wings.\" Like the nagas, they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest devas. In Japan, he is called the Karura, a beast that breathes fire and attacks anyone unless they convert to the teachings of Dainichi Nyorai or unless they are a dragon wearing a Buddhist talisman.\n\nThe exact size of the garuda is uncertain, but its wings are said to have a span of many miles. This may be a poetic exaggeration, but it is also said that when a garuda's wings flap, they create hurricane-like winds that darken the sky and blow down houses. A human being is so small compared to a garuda that a man can hide in the plumage of one without being noticed. They are also capable of tearing up entire banyan trees from their roots and carrying them off.\n\nIn both Hindu and Buddhist mythologies, the garuda is an enemy of the naga race."

As the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle was the king of the birds, the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature, though some believe the griffin was the ancient misconception of a protoceratops. The griffin was also thought of as king of all creatures.\n\nGriffins are normally known for guarding treasure and well valued priceless possessions. Some of the time, only the female has wings and males have spikes on their backs instead of wings. These winged beasts would locate gold in the mountains and built nests from it. Of course, this lured hunters, so griffins kept a very hostile guard over their nests. They would consume the men and devour their horses.\n\nIn antiquity, it was a symbol of divine power and a guardian of the divine. They are well known for their speed, ability to fly and having eyes like an eagle, as well as the strength and courage of a lion. Griffins are also said to be rivals to the dragons."

Nothing yet exists, only pools of water kept at rest under the sky. Soon, the god Huracan appeared before the Sovereign Plumed Serpent to discuss the creation of man. It is decided between the two that the water should be removed and replaced by land. They both spoke the word \"Earth\" until from the mist of the waters the mountains rose. Gukumatz was pleased with their collaborative creation of the earth. The gods created animals such as the deer and the bird, and commanded that their creations should give them praise by speaking their names and keeping their days. But the animals could not speak the words of their gods and simply squawked and chattered. Gukumatz soon realized that their first attempt at the creation of beings was a failure as they could not give them praise. Their animals were ordered to live in the wild and to let their flesh be eaten by the ones who will keep the days of the gods and show them praise.\n\nThey first formed men of mud, but in this form man could neither move nor speak and quickly dissolved into nothingness. Later, they created men of sculpted wood, which Huracan destroyed as the wooden manikins were imperfect, emotionless and showed no praise to the gods. The survivors were then transformed into monkeys, and sentenced to live in the wild. The gods were finally successful in their creation by constructing men out of maize. Here the first men were formed: B'alam Agab, B'alam Quitzé, Iqi B'alam and Mahucatah. Their sight was far and they understood all."

Remorseful for her deeds, Hariti pledged to become the protector of childbirth and children and converted to Buddhism. From then on, she and her brood fed on pomegranates as a substitute for human flesh. This new image of her is what was incorporated into Buddhist lore, which because it came to comprise local Bactrian mythology, took on a new flavor before it spread from northern and western Pakistan to China and the other far reaches of Asia such as Japan."

Like the winds that they originally embodied, the Harpies could come out of nowhere, ruin plans, and destroy people's lives. People blamed them for storms and for any small objects or items of food that mysteriously went missing.\n\nThe harpies were sisters to the Greek goddess Iris."

Hathor has many other names as well, including \"Lady of the Temple of Birth\" and \"Mother of Gods and Men.\" She was described as beautiful woman with a sun disc on her head, which led her to often be confused with the goddess Isis. She is also sometimes depicted with the head of a cow or as a cow entirely. Her alter ego is Sekhmet, the goddess of war and violence.\n\nAs a sky deity, she was the mother or consort of the sky god Horus and the sun god Ra, both of who were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the pharaohs. One of Hathor's roles is a goddess of celebration, dance and music. One of her most important roles is that as a goddess of motherhood and protector of pregnant women. In the earliest myths, she was the mother of Horus, though Isis ultimately supplants this role. Later myths have Hathor becoming the wife of Horus after healing his eye that had been taken out, the Eye of Horus.\n\nHathor was the second-most widely worshiped goddess in Egypt, after Isis. Cleopatra was a fervent devotee, and today the Temple of Hathor still stands. She is identified with the Greek goddess Aphrodite."

It was from this dust that Adam was formed.\n\nIsrafel holds his holy trumpet to his lips century after century, awaiting the signal from God to sound it at the Last Judgement. At this time, he will descend to Earth and stand upon the holy rock in Jerusalem. The first blow of his trumpet will shatter the world, and the second blow will awaken the dead and summon them to judgement.\n\nCertain sources indicate that, created at the beginning of time, Israfel possesses four wings, and is so tall as to be able to reach from the earth to the pillars of Heaven. A beautiful angel who is a master of music, Israfel sings praises to God in a thousand different languages, the breath of which is used to inject life into hosts of angels who add to the songs themselves.\n\nIsrafel has been associated with a number of other angelic names, including Uriel, Sarafiel and Raphael."

Amos 5:26 refers to \"the star of your god.\" His name appears to be derived from the Babylonian name of the planet Saturn. Others suggest that the name comes from a Hebrew root word that refers to something on a pedestal or image stand, and might refer to an idol of another deity rather than a separate god.\n\nKaiwan is only mentioned once in the Tanakh, and in said passage he is associated with the similary unique Sakkuth.[1] This name was seemingly the title of the Mesopotamian god Ninurta, occasionally associated with Saturn. However, unlike other planets, Saturn had minimal importance in Mesopotamian religion. In the biblical text, the names of both of these figures were vocalized like shiqqūts (\"abomination\").[2][3] It's possible there was a deliberate changing of the pronunciation to suggest the idea of detestation of this figure in the eyes of God, much like in the case of Astarte's name being replaced by Ashtoreth.\n\nIn Acts of Apostles, there's a mention of a figure known as Remphan (ῥαιφάν), who seems to be one and the same as Kaiwan. Septuagint renders Kaiwan's name as Rephan.\n\nIn Lovecraftian literature, Kaiwan is also one of the names of Hastur."

He is an embodiment of perfection, a brave leader of god's forces, and a war god, who was created to destroy the demons, representing the negative tendencies in human beings. He rides upon a peacock called Paravani, with a bow and arrow drawn. He also possess the spear, \"Vel of Murugan,\" that Kartikeya used to defeat the inner Asuras and releases the soul from transmigration. Kartikeya's other name, Shadanana, which means \"one with six heads\" corresponds to the five senses and the mind. The six heads also stand for his virtues and enables him to see in all the directions, an important attribute that ensures that he counters all kinds of blows that can hit him.\n\nThe war imagery and the six heads of Kartikeya indicates that if humans wish to lead themselves efficiently through the battle of life, they must always be alert lest they are shown the wrong path by crafty people with the six demonic vices: kaama (sex), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (passion), mada (ego) and matsarya (jealousy). Kartikeya carries in one hand a spear and his other hand is always blessing devotees. His vehicle is a peacock, a pious bird that grips a serpent with its feet, which symbolizes the ego and desires of people. The peacock represents the destroyer of harmful habits and the conqueror of sensual desires. The symbolism of Kartikeya thus points to the ways and means of reaching perfection in life."

After this part, some accounts differ, a few versions stating that when he saw Marduk for the first time, he fled the battlefield, was found and executed by Marduk. In other versions, he was slain on the battlefield by Marduk. Either way, his blood was used by Enki to create humans. Afterwards, he dwelled in the underworld kingdom along with others who had sided with Tiamat.\n\nAnother, unrelated, creature named Qinggu comes from the Chinese mythology.

However, forgetting to thank a knocker will result in a curse, and the knocker will never again show you where the ore lies. It's said that if you look for them, they will get angry and attack you.

She was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured.\n\nIn mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate. Her Roman equivalent was Decima. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she and her sisters (Atropos and Clotho) are the daughters of Nyx and Erebus. In other accounts, they are said to be the daughters of Zeus and Themis as well as several other beings such as Chaos and Ananke.\n\nLachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the Republic of Plato as the daughter of Necessity. She instructs the souls who are about to choose their next life, assigns them lots and presents them all of the kinds, human and animal, from which they may choose their next life.\n\nLachesis, along with her sisters and Hermes, was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people, forced the goddess Aphrodite into making love with other beings, weakened the monster Typhon with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with lightning, and even aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Even though Lachesis and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology. Her name Lakhesis, literally means \"to obtain by lot, by fate or by the will of the gods\"."

The general form is a floating sphere composed of numerous featureless faces that acts as a shell concealing a center core of varying identity.\n\nThe New Testament outlines an encounter where Jesus healed a man possessed by demons, known as \"the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac.\" The demons gave the man superhuman strength but drove him mad. When Jesus approached, the demoniac prostrated himself before him and began to beg. Jesus asked the man's name, and the demons replied their name was \"Legion, for we are many.\" The demons asked that Jesus not banish them; Jesus cast the demons out of the man, granting their request, and allowed them to dwell in a herd of pigs. The pigs then drowned themselves in the Sea of Galilee. Afterward, the man was found sitting peacefully in fresh clothes.\n\nTheir name comes from a Roman word meaning a unit of troops between 3,000 and 6,000 men. The name of Legion has also been used as the personal armies of high-ranking demons."

In one tale, she was the first to eat of the fruit of knowledge and wanted to be either equal to or greater than Adam. After she left the garden of Eden, she attempted to create her own garden and became the consort of many different demons, including the fallen angel Samael, and bore many demons including the succubi known as the Lilim.\n\nMeanwhile Adam grew lonely, and beseeched God to forgive Lilith and return her to Eden. God told Lilith that if she did not return, he would punish her by taking away her children. She refused, her children were taken, and since that day she has become a demoness at war with the sons and daughters of Adam, targeting children in specific. It is also said that she chokes newborn babies to death and feasts on their bones. According to one version, she was the one who sent the snake at Eve, and is usually depicted with snakes. In the later years, she became named as the wife of the devil.\n\nAnother version of the story as told in the \"Midrash Abkier,\" is that after Cain's homicide brings death to the world, Adam separates from Eve and fasts for 130 years. When the demoness Lilith (also known as Pizna) saw his beauty, she instantly desired him, and took him by force by using his own sin against him. She bore him many demonic spirits known to be a plague to mankind."

It has also been sighted in places as varied as the jungles of India and Indonesia and, more rarely, the forests of North America and Europe. The Manticore is said to be a bold creature, being able to take on multiple men at once, and often looking for such opportunities to fill it's appetite. The beast's name comes from the Persian word \"mardkhora,\" or \"man-slayer.\"\n\nIt has the body of a red lion, a human head albeit with three rows of sharp teeth (like a shark), sometimes bat-like wings, a trumpet-like voice and either a dragon or scorpion-like tail which it can shoot spines from. It may shoot venomous spines to either paralyze or kill its victims. It devours its prey whole and leaves no clothes, bones, or possessions of the prey behind.\n\nManticores are fierce predators that patrol a wide area in search of fresh meat. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Some have more human-like heads, usually with beards. Males and females look much alike.\n\nManticores eat any meat, even carrion, though they prefer human flesh and rarely pass up an opportunity for such a delicacy. They are smart and social enough to bargain with or bully evil humanoids into alliances or offering tribute, and more powerful creatures may hire or bribe them to guard or patrol a place or area. They like lairs in high places, such as hilltops and caves in cliffs.\n\nIn Greco-Roman Mythology, the Manticore is one of the children of Typhon and Echidna along with many other monsters. Later, the Manticore would receive more notoriety thanks to a Greek writer, Flavius Philostratus, who recorded a conversation alluding to the existence of the mythical Manticore."

In many religions that incorporate the cosmology of the Hindu originated Trailokya, Mara is said to sit atop at the Sixth Heaven of the Desire Realm that includes the mortal world, and is said to be both that which ensnares souls in Samsara by deceiving them with promises of happiness in the Desire Realms, and who is the ultimate obstacle of any who desire to achieve enlightenment into nirvana and sunyata.\n\nFeeling threatened by the enlightenment the Buddha was trying to bestow upon humanity, he attacked Gautama Buddha when he was meditating beneath the bodhi tree. He was defeated when the Buddha simply touched the tips of his fingers to the earth, whereupon all the gods descended in a tremendous roar to pay homage to him. Though Mara was defeated that time, he still lingers in the world, hoping to seize the souls of the dying and unenlightened.\n\nOriginated in Sri Lankan Buddhism, a demon who was riding Girimehkala with a penis-headed image tried to stop Siddharta Gautama from reaching enlightenment through meditation. The most common story depicts Mara using his beautiful daughters in an attempt to tempt the Buddha; he later marched his demonic army to scare him, however this ended in failure for Mara.\n\nThere was a metaphor known as Devaputra-mara which is the disillusion of regarding Mara as an objective being."

He is the being who is the nearest in hierarchy to that of God. He is said to have the largest body among all of the angels, having 36 wings, 3 representing the triumvirate of the father (God), the son (Jesus Christ) and the holy ghost, multiplied by the 12 tribes of Israel (God's chosen people). In ancient Judaism, his status is even higher than that of the Archangel Michael.\n\nHe received various titles such as \"Face of God,\" \"Angel of Contracts\" synonymous with the Iranian God Mithra, \"King of Angels\" and others of the like. His name literally means \"He who sits behind the throne of Heaven.\" Metatron is also said to be the twin brother of the archangel Sandalphon.\n\nAlthough Metatron isn't an official angel according to the ecumenical teachings of modern Christendom (nor does he appear in any of the Old or New Testament books and letters of the Bible), his celebrity is certainly not without consequence. As put forth in several of the ancient Enochian texts (especially the Slavonic Secrets of Enoch text 2, one of many deuterocanonicals attributed to Enoch), Metatron takes on the heavenly role as God's mediator with all mankind. Some of said texts even go so far as to assert that Metatron is actually the holy ghost of Christianity (see 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch). As such, particularly to the Gnostics in upper Mesopotamia via the \"Nag Hammadi\" transcripts, Metatron is portrayed to be the most mysterious, as well as the highest, in the order of the heavenly host."

What is certain is that the lion-headed deity is associated with time and seasonal change.\n\nIn Vedic mythology, Mitra is a god of honesty, friendship, meetings and contracts despite his role as an asura (although he is sometimes addressed as a deva). In this way, he was often paired with the asura Varuna where they were twinned as Mitra-Varuna. Together, they were the gods of the oath and the most important Asura in the Vedic pantheon.

	"background":"Moloch, or Molech, refers to a particular kind of sacrifice or possibly a god associated with fire, known first and foremost from the Bible. According to Leviticus, children were burned as an offering to Moloch. While Christian and Jewish tradition present Moloch as a demonic idol, an influential theory first formed in the the 1930s interprets the name as a term for a form of sacrifice analogous to the Punic mlk.[1] According to the Romans, child offerings were one of the main forms of worship of the \"african Saturn\" (Baal Hammon), the tutelary god of Carthage, leading to the assumption that mlk known from insctiptions from Punic sites is the rite of child sacrifice.\n\nIn the middle ages, the idea of Moloch as a bull-headed monster developed, possibly under the influence of the myth of the Minotaur.[2] Moloch understood as a demonic entity absorbed elements of Roman texts about Baal Hammon, leading to the incorrect assumption that Moloch is a title of the main biblical Baal (Hadad), an unrelated deity. While the extent of Carthaginian child sacrifice (or, according to some, the very historicity of it) is debated, it is generally agreed that it was not a feature of Mesopotamian religion[3], and extensive offering lists from Hadad's major cult center, Ugarit, indicate only the sacrifice of animals and wares.[4]\n\nScholars who reject the interpretation of Moloch as a term for sacrifice instead associate this name with various little known deities of the ancient Canaan and Mesopotamia, including the Ammonite lead god Milcom; Malik, a god or a divine title from Ebla, Mari and Nineveh; or mlkm from Ugaritic god lists, possibly an underworld deity. However, none of these figures are associated with human sacrifice, let alone with the specific form of it associated with Moloch.\n\nDue to a passage from the Book of Kings, according to which the Moabite King Mesha sacrificed his own son to Chemosh to achieve victory over Israel, Moloch and Chemosh were sometimes treated as interchangeable in old scholarship.[5]\n\nChemosh was an ancient deity first attested in texts from the bronze age city of Ebla. He was also possibly associated with Carchemish (before the rise of Kubaba as the most important tutelary deity of the area), as indicated by the city's name. A few references in Ugaritic texts might imply that he was originally an underworld deity similar to Nergal.[6] In later times, he became the national deity of the Moabites, as evidenced by the Mesha Stele and by a large number of theophoric names recorded in Assyrian sources. The Moabites also conflated him with the Arabian Ashtar to strenghten his role as a god who, according to their beliefs, brought them victory in wars. In the past, this was erroneously understood as an implied connection between Moloch and Ishtar or Astarte.\n\nIn the Bible, Chemosh is mentioned in the compound \"people of Chemosh,\" referring to Moabites. A single passage from the Book of Judges calls him the god of the Ammonites instead, contrary to other biblical accounts. Deuteronomy lists Chemosh as one of the forbidden foreign idols embraced by some Israelites. In this context, he's grouped with Astarte and Milcom, representing Sidonians (Phoenicians) and Ammonites, respectively. As an idol he's also called \"the abomination of Moab.\"\n\nIn the Book of Numbers, under Moabite influence, the Israelites started worshiping an otherwise unknown Moabite god referred to as \"Baal Peor\" (an inspiration for the name of the demon Belphegor) who was identified as one and the same as Chemosh in John Milton's Paradise Lost and in some later scholarly sources.[7] However, modern Bible researchers treat Baal Peor as a distinct deity.[8]"

He \"lives in the throne city which goes by the name Hemry, a pit is his throne, and Filth is the land of his heritage.\" According to another text, he holds \"the scepter of widowhood\" and \"the scepter of bereavement.\" He is prominently featured in the mythology of Ugarit, but some mentions survive in later Phoenician texts as well.\n\nA few references in the Bible also appear to be a memory of Mot, such as vague mentions of seemingly personified death in the books of Hosea, Habakkuk and Jeremiah. Evidence from Ugarit indicates Mot was not worshiped, and he isn't attested in theophoric names; he was a demonic personification of an abstract concept rather than a god.[1] This makes him distinct from other Semitic figures associated with the afterlife, such as Nergal.\n\nIn Ugaritic mythology, he is one of the sons of the high god El, and as such serves as one of the enemies of the weather god Baal Hadad, whose life-giving waters brought life to the land. Mot was the lord of the desert dryness, the underworld, and all that is opposed to life, and as such an antithesis of Baal. Some researchers argue that Baal's battle with Mot represented his role as a champion of the cause of mortal men, whose divine aid was crucial in preserving human life.\n\nAccording to the Baal Cycle, Mot was another figure considered to be \"beloved of El\" (the most favored among his sons) like Yam. After Baal had defeated the sea god and established his palace on Mount Saphon, he sent his messengers to announce the news to Mot, possibly expecting a tribute from him. In response, Mot described his insatiable hunger for flesh and challenged Baal. The following passages in the text are lost or unclear, but it is known that this ordeal culminated in Baal's death, followed by Mot's dismemberment at the hands of Anat. After Baal's resurrection and return to the throne, Mot likewise reappeared to complain about his treatment. Another fight broke out between them, but this time the sun goddess Shapash intervened and informed Mot that it is Baal who has El's favor. As a result, Mot presumably returned to the underworld. He makes few, if any, appearances in other Ugaritic myths."

She is depicted as a beautiful woman who is \"the mother of all harlots and of all abominations of the world.\" While incredibly powerful and terrifying, she is destined to meet her end at the hands of The Beast as part of the apocalypse.\n\nShe appears as wearing a purple robe. The color purple was associated with the Roman Empire. The beast she rides has seven heads and Rome has seven hills, so the heads could reflect the ancient power of Rome, which traditionally was one of antiquity's most powerful empires. Alternatively, the heads of the beast could represent the seven great kingdoms of the ancient world and their rulers.\n\nOne interpretation is that the seven heads represent the seven different forms of Roman governance: kings, consuls, decemviri (council of 10), dictators, triumviri (council of 3), caesars (military emperors) and despotic emperors.\n\nShe is also probably a reference to Dante's Divine Comedy, Canto XXXII of the Purgatory, in which a chariot representing the History of the Church becomes a seven-headed-beast with a prostitute on his back. This event in the Comedy is a symbolism of corrupted popes and emperors in history."

In the other version, it is a beast that is the result of a mating between a lion and an ant. It has the face of a lion and the body of an ant, with each part having its appropriate nature. Because the lion part will only eat meat and the ant part can only digest grain, the ant-lion starves.\n\nThe ant-lion story may come from a mistranslation of a word in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, from the book of Job. The word in Hebrew is lajisch, an uncommon word for lion, which in other translations of Job is rendered as either lion or tiger; in the Septuagint it is translated as mermecolion, ant-lion."

While many myths portray him as an unruly, chaotic deity with little respect for most of the other gods, he was frequently invoked in apotropaic rituals meant to ward off misfortune. He was also described as a punisher of evildoers.[2] In at least one text he was referred to as the \"sunset king\" because of the belief that at night the sun traveled through the underworld.[3] Some scholars therefore identified Nergal himself as a solar deity in the past.[4] However, modern research generally only views the planet Mars as Nergal's astral aspect.[5]\n\nNergal's main myths are the Epic of Erra, detailing his exploits in war, and Nergal and Ereshkigal, explaining the origin of his marriage to Ereshkigal, who was also a goddess of the underworld herself. It's possible the second myth was meant to reconcile two conflicting views on the underworld by making the central deities featured in them husband and wife. Unlike the ever popular Nergal, Ereshkigal only had a limited cult, and in fact one of the few known temples dedicated to her was located in Nergal's city, Kutha.[6] Other goddesses, for example Inanna's vizier Ninshubur, were also sometimes viewed as Nergal's wives.[7] His parents were Enlil and Ninil.\n\nNergal, like Ares and Mars, was sometimes associated with the planet Mars, which to the Mesopotamians was an ill omen associated with war and other calamities. His other symbols were the bull, the lion and a lion-headed mace.\n\nDue to Nergal's fearsome nature he is known as a demon in popular culture, sometimes being identified with Satan. Colin DePlancy cites him as a spy in service of Beelzebub and chief of Hell's secret police.[8]"

Although he has the face of a handsome young man, a curse has made him no taller than a young child that he received shortly after birth. However, the curse gives him eternal beauty.\n\nOberon is described as a benevolent being by the Fae, although others state that he is quite malicious when a certain incident affects the well being of his kingdom and people. He is polite and sometimes even friendly towards humans, however, he can be a selfish, short-tempered ruler, often falling in love and flirting with human women, only to be restrained by his consort Titania. It is said that when Oberon is angry, his rage affects the very weather and causes nature to fall into discord. The two are said to have once lived in India, and they would cross the sea to Europe at night to dance in the moonlight.\n\nHe first became widely known when he appeared as a character in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night’s Dream,\" but appeared earlier in the 13th century French epic \"Huon of Bordeaux.\" In some stories, specifically in \"Huon of Bordeaux,\" it is said that he is the son of Morgan le Fey and Julius Caesar, believed to have been born some time after Caesar's defeat of Pompey."

He is associated with wisdom, war, frenzy, knowledge, battle and death and also magic, sorcery, poetry, the gallows, healing, royalty, prophecy, victory and the hunt, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg.\n\nOdin is often portrayed as being an eminently honorable ruler and battlefield commander, but to the ancient Norse, he was nothing of the sort. In contrast to more straightforwardly noble war gods such as Tyr or Thor, Odin incites otherwise peaceful people to strife with what is a downright sinister glee. He maintains particularly close affiliations with the berserkers and other “warrior-shamans” whose fighting techniques and associated spiritual practices center around achieving a state of ecstatic unification with certain ferocious totem animals. He is also known by hundreds of names some which includes: Wodan, Aldagautr, Biflindi, Bileygr, Draugadróttinn, Dróttinn, Fengr, Fjölnir, Forni, Grímnir, Hangi, Hávi, Jölnir and Vegtam.\n\nHe only has one eye because he bartered the other in order to drink from the well of Mimir and gain its knowledge. He had many abilities like astral projection, shapeshifting and control of the elements and weather. He also could read magic runes that no one else could since he had hung himself from the World Tree Yggdrasil while inflicting self-torture in order to gain great knowledge.\n\nOdin is the chief god of the Norse pantheon. He and his brothers Ve and Vili killed the frost giant Ymir and built the world from his body. He is also the father of most of the gods, including Thor, Vidarr and Baldur, who was later killed by a manipulated Hod with a dart of mistletoe. He is associated with his spear Gungnir, the wolves Geri and Freki and the two ravens Hugin and Munin, and the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.\n\nOdin is given primacy over female beings associated with the battlefield, the Valkyries, and he himself oversees the afterlife location Valhalla of Asgard, where he receives half of those who die in battle, the Einherjar. The other half are chosen by goddess Freya for her afterlife location, Fólkvangr. In Ragnarok, he gets devoured by the great wolf Fenrir."

However, the humans needed more space but the tools they had on hand were made from a soft metal that couldn't do much. That was when Ogun received the secrets of iron from the son of the supreme god, Olorun. Using the wisdom he acquired, Ogun made an iron axe and chopped up the trees to create space for the humans. He then divulged the wisdom he gained with all the humans and gods that were on the earth.\n\nPersonality wise, Ogun is described to be a very fierce god with an abundance of energy, due to his status as a warrior. Although people usually look up to his power, an enraged Ogun will turn his power on the people he watches over."

One thing remains true throughout however, the couple's web of broken trust and promises ultimately leads to Aoyama killing Okiku, and casting her body down into a well. Her spirit then returns to haunt the grounds, either out of sorrow or anger.\n\nIn 1795, Japan suffered from an infestation of a type of worm that could be found in old wells that came to be named Okiku mushi. This worm, covered in a thick thread as if it were bound, was believed to be the reincarnation of Okiku.

	"background":"Pa Bil Sag, or Pabilsag, was the tutelary god for the cities of Larak and (alongside his wife) Isin in Mesopotamian mythology. He was regarded as a son of Enlil, who was also the father of Nergal. Early on, he was conflated with yet another of Enlil's sons, the popular god Ninurta, which makes it difficult to identify his original attributes. It's possible he was a god of healing, of law, a netherworld deity, or perhaps a divine huntsman.[1] He was also a war god known under the title of \"Warrior of Enlil,\" likely borrowed from Ninurta.\n\nThe most significant text related to Pabilsag is Pabilsag's journey to Nibru, in which he honored Enlil and presented him with many gifts. This myth calls him \"the wild bull with multicolored legs.\" It seems that a partially preserved fragment additionally describes his marriage to Nininsinna, a healer goddess.[2] Together they had a son, Damu, who was himself a healing god; some researchers consider him to be analogous to Dumuzid.[3]\n\nOriginally, Pabilsag was depicted in the garb of an official, but later art sometimes shows him as a centaur-like figure with the tail of a scorpion. In this form, he was associated with the constellation Sagittarius. He wasn't an influence on the Greek centaurs.\n\nIn the Enuma Elish, when Tiamat waged war on the gods, scorpion men, distinct from the god Pabilsag, were among the creatures fighting for her. Like her other servants, they were vanquished by Marduk.\n\nThe hero Gilgamesh encountered scorpion men during his search for immortality. A pair of them, seemingly husband and wife, guarded the gates located at Mount Mashu, where the sun was said to rise, which Gilgamesh had to pass to reach his destination. While described as fearsome (their \"glance is death\"), they are not malevolent in this myth, unlike their Enuma Elish equivalents, and let Gilgamesh continue his journey."

Another story says that he made the first man and the first woman, but forgot to give them food — and when the man died and the woman prayed over Pachacamac's head to his father Inti to make her the mother of all the peoples of earth, Pachacamac was furious. One by one, as the children were born, he tried to kill them — only to be beaten and to be thrown into the sea by her hero-son Wichama, after which he gave up the struggle and contented himself by becoming the supreme god of fish."

The rider traditionally represents death and bears a scythe of death. Despite typically being portrayed carrying a scythe as his weapon (much like the Grim Reaper), in the Book of Revelation, he is described as bringing Hades (Hell) wherever he rides as his symbol. His color being pale, as opposed to an actual color, could be reflecting the sickly appearance of a corpse (though old translations could be interpreted as the rider being pale green and yellowish green.)\n\nUnlike the other three Horsemen, Death has also been specifically mentioned in texts surrounding the Day of Judgement where God himself takes both Hades and Death, alongside the Devil and all his followers and places them in the Lake of Fire for all of eternity."

She represents just decisions and strategic warfare and is the only goddess allowed to carry Zeus' thunderbolts. She led battles as the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother Ares, the patron of violence, bloodlust and slaughter.\n\nShe has aided numerous heroes such as Heracles and Perseus, and supported the Greeks during the Trojan War. Although her given name is Athena, she adopted the name of her friend Pallas after killing him in battle. It was at this time that Zeus gave her the Aegis, a piece of armor capable of protecting her from all evil and disaster.\n\nShe was depicted crowned, with a crested helm, armed with a shield and spear. She is commonly shown accompanied by her sacred animal, the owl. She is the virgin patron of Athens, which was named in honor of her (the Parthenon, which overlooks the city, was a temple the Athenians dedicated to her.) The Greeks especially also associate the olive with her, as she won a contest against Poseidon to decide who would be the patron god or goddess of what would become Athens when she planted an olive tree as a gift to the city.\n\nAlthough Perseus' conquest of Medusa is well known, Medusa was originally a ravishing woman with beautiful hair. She was so enamored with herself that she boasted one day that her hair was more beautiful than that of even Athena. In a fit of rage, Athena turned Medusa's hair into snakes that would turn anyone who looked at them into stone. Still unsatisfied, Athena had Perseus slay Medusa and is then said to have fitted Medusa's head into the Aegis to make it even more powerful. Another version was that Medusa herself was a high-priestess of Athena. Loyal and devout, Medusa's near supernatural beauty prompted people to make attempts at wooing her and would often come to Athena's temple simply to see Medusa. Of the men who wished to have the beautiful Medusa as their own, the most powerful was Poseidon, the Lord of the Ocean who was determined to make her his own. Using his divine powers, Poseidon made Medusa enter a dream-like state in which she succumbed to his advances. Outraged at Medusa having had been seduced by her arch-enemy, Athena punished the high-priestess by transforming her into the first gorgon. As a gorgon those fair features were hideously wrought and those golden locks twisted to hissing vipers. Anyone that met her eyes was petrified, a statue for all eternity."

Pisacas have the power to assume different forms at will and may also become invisible. Sometimes, they possess human beings, and the victims are afflicted with a variety of maladies and abnormalities like insanity. Certain mantras are supposed to cure such afflicted persons, and drive away the Pisaca which may be possessing that particular human being.

Depending on the tale told, pixies can vary in size from tiny enough to fit in the palm of a human's hand to the size of a small child, although they are always a good deal below the size of an average human. They can be portrayed with or without wings, and over the years have taken on many traits usually associated with fairies, often leading to the common misconception that they are one and the same.\n\nPixies are sometimes said to be born in much the same way as humans, however some tales tell that they are humans transformed through misdeeds or magic. They play pranks on humans such as stealing their belongings, throwing things or calling out their names. They may also steal horses during the night and return them by the morning with tangled manes. While pixies usually don't cause any real harm, it is said that if someone follows the voices of pixies, they will never return."

They seek recognition and attention, and will do anything to receive it, even if they are violent and deadly methods. The best defining mark of a poltergeist is any manipulation of the physical environment, such as the movement of objects, physical attacks, spontaneous combustion and so forth. They lift and move objects around and make loud and unexplainable noises.\n\nMuch of the time, the poltergeist phenomenon is incorrectly credited to mischievous spirits, ghosts or extremely negative entities. However, more modern scientific studies reveal convincing arguments that poltergeists are associated with psychokinesis.\n\nA common factor of classic poltergeist activity is the presence of an adolescent, usually female, in the household or for all of the activity to be centered around one specific person. It's not uncommon for the activity to not take place unless that person is present at the time. In most cases, when that specific person is removed from the location, the events cease.\n\nThey are often associated with paranormal activity, and, rarely, demonic possession."

Generally, they are the spirits of greedy, jealous or corrupted people who have become, for their negative karma, demons with an insatiable appetite for a particular substance, that can vary from corpses to anything bizarre. In some Buddhism religions, Preta is the name of one of the Six Realms that represent the Six States of Rebirth. In the Chinese traditional religion, they are beings driven by intense emotional needs in an animalistic way. In the modern Japanese language, spoiled children are called \"gaki,\" as a reference to this demon.\n\nPreta are described as human-like spirits that are usually invisible to the human eyes depending on their mental state. They have sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs, an enormously distended belly and a long, thin neck; their appearance, as so, reflect their state of insatiable hunger.\n\nIn Japanese art, they are represented with bulging stomachs and small mouths and throats or as balls of smoke or fire, and are shown, usually, licking spilled water in temples, accompanied by demons that represent their agony. They dwell in the wastes and in the deserts and usually have problems while dealing with their hunger and end up becoming even more hungry: someone can eat a little, but have difficulties in finding food or drinks or have problems swallowing food; some even find that what they eat seems to burst into flames or see the food they desire vanishing before their eyes.\n\nIn Hinduism, their body is composed of air and akaash (comparable to aether, black matter or space), and since they are missing three elements (fire, water and earth), physical intake and digestion is not possible for them. They usually suffer similar conditions to those in hell, but they can freely move instead of being confined in a subterranean world.\n\nPreta are usually not seen by humans as a nuisance unless their hunger is for blood, though in some other traditions, they prevent others from satisfying their own desire. Many times, though, they are seen as beings to be pitied and, for example, in some monasteries monks leave them some offerings before meals; some Japanese Buddhists also dedicate a day to remember them, as they believe that such offerings and remembrances will, someday, free them from their endless pain."

Simply put, it meant \"the guy with the lantern.\" Later the term would almost exclusively be used as slang in reference to the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon, or ignis fatuus; due to the appearance of a far off person carrying a lantern."

The tale surrounding this is that she proceeded to take her revenge by killing off half the kingdom, which by then belonged to her and Dharmodayana's son Erlangga, with plague before being overcome by a holy man. The name Rangda itself means \"widow\" in old Javanese and Balinese language. It may also be associated with the legend of a demon queen named Calon Arang, who wreaked havoc in late 10th century Java, during the reign of Airlangga.\n\nRangda is important in Balinese culture, and performances depicting her struggles with Barong or with Airlangga in that tale are popular tourist attractions as well as tradition. She is depicted as a mostly nude old woman, with long and unkempt hair, pendulous breasts and claws. Her face is traditionally a horrifying fanged and goggle-eyed mask, with a long, protruding tongue.\n\nIt has been suggested that Rangda may be closely associated with the Hindu warrior mother goddess Durga, or the black goddess of destruction Kali, given that Bali is a Hindu island. While Rangda is mainly seen as fearsome and a personification of evil, she is also seen as a protective figure in some parts of Bali. The colors associated with Rangda are red, black and white, and these colors are also associated with Kali, and her iconography is also similar to Kali. Mahendradatta, the queen Rangda might be based on, was known for her devotion to the cult of Durga in Bali."

He represents war, and his horse is colored \"fiery\" red and bearing a sword of war. Unlike Conquest, the Red Horseman of War specializes in waging war between nations and people rather than internal strife.\n\nHe holds a great sword upwards as though ready to battle or mass slaughter. The sword is meant to suggest that blood will be spilled. The great sword being held upwards can also be viewed as a declaration of war, as typically, crossed swords held upward in heraldry signify entering in battle. He takes peace from the Earth and allows men to kill one another.\n\nThe color of the horse, coupled with the rider's sword, symbolizes the great blood shed that must ultimately befall the world, and to some he also symbolizes divine wrath and spiritual warfare, making him even more formidable than he already appears."

In recent times, some have come to identify a legendary salamander as a distinct concept separate from the real organism. This idea is mostly developed in the occult. Where the two concepts can be distinguished, the legendary salamander is most often depicted as a typical salamander in shape, with a lizard-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with fire.\n\nUnlike other elementals, a salamander is typically seen as a violent and temperamental spirit much like a roaring fire, and yet it can be reduced to a wise and majestic being like how fire is capable of placing others in a trance due to its inherit beauty. The salamanders are considered the strongest and most powerful of all the elementals. It has also been said that salamanders can be mischievous at times."

His name means \"poison of God,\" suggesting he is either the vengeful hand of God or the enemy of God, and it has even been suggested that Samael is the angelic name of Satan himself.\n\nIn some early Jewish lore, Samael is the angel of death and chief ruler of the Fifth Heaven with two million angels at his command, residing himself within the Seventh Heaven. In one of these texts, the \"Deuteronomy Rabbah\" Samael is sent by God to retrieve the soul of Moses. He fails to do so as Moses blinds him by beating him with a staff engraved with God's true name, thus forcing God to intervene and remove Moses' soul personally.\n\nHe was also said to be the guardian angel of Esau (older brother of Jacob, who was renamed Israel, father of the Jews). In the Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer, Samael is charged with being the one who seduced and impregnated Eve with Cain. Other scholars suggest it was Azazel who seduced Eve and it was Samael who tempted Eve in the guise of the Serpent.\n\nIn Kabbalah, Samael is named as the fifth archangel in the world of Briah who took Lilith as his bride when she left Adam. He was also said to have mated with several of the angels of prostitution.\n\nIn some forms of Gnosticism, Samael is an alternate name for the Demiurge."

Through this they ascend to God, and return to their place. It is said that the seraphim flew about the throne on which God was seated, singing his praises as they called special attention to God's glory and majesty.

	"origin":"Egyptian Mythology",
	"background":"Set, also spelled Seth, Sutekh or Sūtaḫ, is a deity from Egyptian mythology. Set is the deity of deserts, storms and chaos and served as one of the greatest deities in Egyptian myth. Set was married to the goddess Nephthys, who was also his sister. He killed and dismembered his brother Osiris out of jealousy. Isis, Osiris' wife and sister, reassembled him and Osiris became the ruler of the dead. Isis gave birth to Osiris's child, Horus, who became an enemy of Set. In earlier myths, Set fought Apep each night as Ra journeyed through the underworld.\n\nAt the peak of Egyptian power, Set was also viewed as a god of foreigners and was equated with many Canaanite, Hittite and Libyandeities, including Baal, Teshub, the sun goddess of Arinna and Ash. Association with Baal was responsible for viewing Anat and Astarte as Set's consorts; additionally, some depictions of Set showed him in human form and the garb of a Canaanite warrior god. The so-called Astarte papyrus influenced by this tradition preserves a myth in which Set was a heroic god similar to Baal, battling Ym much like Baal did in Ugaritic myths.\n\nSet had been demonized to some extent, and the Greeks interpreted him as evil, which may be one of the reasons he is viewed as an antagonistic force in later depictions. An additional factor was the change in Egypt's foreign relations after the bronze age collapse; while in the bronze age the pharaohs ruled a large area in the Levant and maintained peace with the Hittites on favorable to themselves terms, in later times the Assyrians, who emerged as a new power after the fall of the Hittite empire, were able to pillage or even temporarily conquer Egypt. Therefore it's possible that Set's acquired status as a god of foreigners, especially these inhabiting the Levant and Mesopotamia, made him a scapegoat of sorts for hatred against the aggressors.\n\nSeth was one of the earliest major Egyptian deities to be demonized. Already associated with the uncertainties and hardships of the open desert, he had a bad, but not ignoble reputation. Due to Set's ties with his mortal enemy Apep, the two became ironically intertwined. Because of this, especially in the western world, conceptions of Set began to take on the serpentine features of Apep. This is further confounded by the inability of archeologists to identify a specific animal-form to Set, so instead the label \"Typhonic\" was adopted, like-Typhon of Greek mythology, which is to say of many forms, primeval, and generically serpentine. It is not impossible to see how it was Set became likened to serpents, even while no such relationship exists. It is even possible because Set's animal-head often adorns staves, the long slender snake-like shape of a staff was attributed to Set, such as when Moses transmutes a staff into a snake in the Old Testament. And even in modern times images of Set have been probably more influenced by the fictional demi-god Set of Father Set Conan fame than any actual representation of Set.\n\nAll of this comes to a head in the second Digital Devil Story novel which features Set, Typhon and Apeps (plural), and in league with one another. Moreover, Seth's final form in the novel is a giant snake."

Shiisa are holy beasts that possess the power to repel demons and exorcise evil spirits that cause fires. A legendary creature said to repel disasters and misfortune and bring good luck to villages. Shiisa resemble a cross between a lion and a dog. Their form is thought to be derived from the lions of the ancient Orient.\n\nShiisa statues can be found in a variety of places, such as on the roofs of houses and outside temples. The statues are placed so that they face northeast (toward the Demon gate), south (to guard against fire), or the direction of a gate or cross-street. Paired figurines of them are often set at entrances to houses. In Okinawa, souls of the deceased become balls of fire and will burn houses, but Shiisaa keeps such spirits out.\n\nThere are many stories about it in Ryukyu lore. They are the local version of the Chinese shishi."

He originally evolved from the early Vedic god, Rudra, and is now the supreme deity within Shaivism, a branch of Hinduism that focuses on the worship of Shiva. While he is known as the destroyer, he is also considered to be a benevolent and beneficial force, as without destruction, new creation couldn't take place. He also acts against premature destruction, going far enough to withstand great suffering. He is depicted with up to four arms, a third eye, a blue throat, matted hair, carrying a trident and a drum, is often accompanied by a serpent and rides on the back of the sacred bull Nandi.\n\nThe first of Shiva's best known attributes is his third eye, which he once used to burn the god of love, Kamadeva, to ashes. The effulgence from this act was so hot that not even the god of fire, Agni, could handle it, and was used to create the war god Kartikeya. Shiva also has a blue throat that was caused when he swallowed the most deadly poison in the world, Halahala, the poison of the primordial snake Vasuki, earning him the name Vishakantha (one who held poison in his throat). This act is further proof of his benevolent and self-sacrificing nature.\n\nHe is the husband of the goddess Parvati, or Shakti, in all her incarnations and has two sons, Ganesha and Skanda. He also has many incarnations that would go on to become sacred figures in their own right such as Shankara and Hanuman. Shiva is also worshiped in forms born from the fusion of himself and other gods, such as Harihara when fused with Vishnu or Ardhanarishvara when he's fused Parvati or Shakti.\n\nFollowers of a religion called Shaktism believe the Shiva is an aspect or reflection of the Divine Mother, or Shakti.\n\nAnother name for Shiva is Mahakala, who, in Buddhism, is a fierce protector deity who is equivalent to Shiva."

Today, many unique interpretations of mythological figures including Skadi and Mem Aleph by Walker are largely dismissed as unreliable, but her influence has already been spread to the modern popular culture including the Megami Tensei series. Not only Skadi's design by Kazuma Kaneko which is completely black from head to toe, in the Japanese version of all games of the series, Skadi's background commentary recycles the same prose which cites Walker's theory without mentioning Skadi's origin as a Norse snowshoe goddess."

Knowing that she would wake them if there were any problems, they were able to sleep, and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place.\n\nIn some traditions, the Skogsra lures men into the forest to have sexual intercourse with her, rewarding those who satisfy her and often killing those who do not. The Norwegian Skogsra is a lot less bloodthirsty and may simply kidnap a man or lure him into the underworld. She sometimes steals human infants and replaces them with her own ugly changeling children.\n\nSometimes she marries a local farm boy, but when this happens, the glamour leaves her when the priest lays his hand on her or when she enters the church. Some legends tell of husbands who subsequently treat her badly. Some fairy tales leave out this feature, and only relate how a marriage to a Christian man will cause her to lose her tail, but not her looks, and let the couple live happily ever after. However, if she is treated badly, she will remind him that she is far from weak, often by straightening out a horseshoe with her bare hands, sometimes while it is still glowing hot from the forge."

The giant used the magical horse Svadilfari to complete their task on time. Loki changed himself into a mare and seduced Svadilfari. This was done to delay the giant builder of the walls of Asgard from completing them on time, which would allow him to take the goddess Freya for himself.

This sphinx is described as having the head (and in later times, breasts) of a woman, the body of a lion, and the wings of an eagle. It sat on the road to the city of Thebes, and asked all who passed by a famous riddle: \"What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs at night?\" She killed all those who answered wrong.

Unlike many other Zoroastrian figures, he has no counterpart in Vedic texts. His name corresponds to the concept of obedience. He propagates religious doctrine on earth, and serves as a medium between the faithful and Ahura Mazda (Ohrmazd). While he's already prominent in the Gathas, the oldest Zoroastrian sacred texts, in later sources, he was eventually elevated to a position almost equal to that of Ohrmazd himself, being tasked with protecting the material world.[1] In this role, he's a scourge of evil beings. His strength is described as unusual, and the weapon he uses to dispatch evildoers is a club. His archenemy and antithesis is Aeshma, also known for using a mace.\n\nIn the Avesta, a few passages associate him with Rashnu and Mithra. Later texts expand this association, making them a trio of judges who decide the fate of each soul in the afterlife. Sraosha also serves as a psychopomp, protecting the righteous souls from attacks of demons (especially Aeshma) while they cross the Chinvat bridge, behind which lies the Zoroastrian heaven. It's also said that during Frashokereti, a day of universal renewal and ultimate triumph of Ohrmazd, Sraosha will assist him in judging humans. This will also be the day of his ultimate triumph over Aeshma.\n\nDue to his prominent role in many of the legends derived from Zoroastrian texts which were collected in the 11th century epic poem Shahnameh, Sraosha is also present in Persianate Islamic art as an angel named Surush."

As air spirits, they can disappear and cause gentle breezes with their voices.\n\nSometimes they are depicted as cloud beings, and are also believed to be responsible for the myths of angels. Their attitudes embody the extremes of nature, mercurial and intense. Most of all, they defend the high peaks and wilderness mountains that are their home. Sylphs care little for the machinations and politics of \"ground folk\", and they rarely interfere with society.\n\nThe name Sylph is derived from the Latin \"silva,\" meaning forest, and it is thought that they came from Nymphs of Greek lore."

Thor is one of the most powerful gods and uses his superior power to protect Asgard and Midgard. Due to his lust for battle and incredible prowess, Thor is also portrayed as a war god and also an agricultural god due to his status as a weather deity that aids in the growth of crops. His belt Mejingjard doubles his strength and lightning flashes every time he throws his trusty hammer, Mjölnir.\n\nMost surviving stories relating to Germanic mythology either mention Thor or center on Thor's exploits. Thor was a much revered god of the ancient Germanic people from at least the earliest surviving written accounts of the indigenous Germanic tribes to over a thousand years later in the late Viking Age. Thor was very talented at slaying the Jotuns; many of his stories revolve around violent episodes between him and his enemies. One of his exploits, includes his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent, Jormungandr, and his foretold death by succumbing to its venom, during the events of Ragnarök are recorded throughout sources in Norse mythology.\n\nThor was appealed to for protection on numerous objects found from various Germanic tribes. Miniature replicas of Mjölnir, the weapon of Thor, became a defiant symbol of Norse paganism during the Christianization of Scandinavia. Casting molds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered."

They come the closest of all angels to spiritual perfection and emanate the light of God with mirror-like goodness. They, despite their greatness, are intensely humble, an attribute that allows them to dispense justice with perfect objectivity and without fear of pride or ambition.\n\nBecause they are living symbols of God's justice and authority, they are called Thrones and have as one of their symbols the throne. In contrast to their appearance, Ezekiel 1:15 describes Thrones as eye covered wheels, rather than humanoids. One of the Dead Sea Scrolls construes them as angels, late sections of the Book of Enoch portray them as a class of celestial beings who never sleep, but guard the throne of God.\n\nSome Christian theologians that include the Thrones as one of the choirs do not describe them as wheels, describing them as adoring elder men who listen to the will of God and present the prayers of men.

There were originally twelve Titans: six male Titans and six females, known as the Titanesses, with more coming afterwards. The Titans were associated with various primal concepts, some of which are simply extrapolated from their names: ocean and fruitful earth, sun and moon, memory and natural law.\n\nAmong the first generation of twelve Titans, the females were Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Rhea, and Themis and the males were Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Cronus, Crius, and Iapetus. The second generation of Titans consisted of Hyperion's children Helios, Selene, and Eos; Coeus' children Lelantos, Leto, and Asteria; Iapetus' sons Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius; Oceanus' daughter Metis; and Crius' sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses. These twelve Titans were ruled by the youngest, Cronus who overthrew their father, Ouranos, at the urging of their mother, Gaia.\n\nThe Titans preceded the Twelve Olympians, who, led by Zeus, the son of the Titan leader, Cronus, eventually rebel against them in the Titanomachy. The Titanomachy was said to have lasted for ten years. Their role as elder gods being overthrown by a race of younger gods, and imprisoned them within Tartarus, the deepest reaches of Hades, the Greek Underworld, with the few exceptions such as Oceanus, most being those who did not fight against Cronus."

Titania resides in the Kingdom of Fairyland, where she rules over the moonlit Fairy Forest. While considered stunningly beautiful and delicate, she is also portrayed as a very proud fairy, with powers that easily match those of her husband.\n\nShe is derived from the fairy queen character in William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, which in traditional folklore had no name. In the play, Titania and Oberon are engaged in a marital quarrel over which of them should have the keeping of an Indian changeling boy. This quarrel is the engine that drives the mix-ups and confusion of the other characters in the play. Due to an enchantment cast by Oberon's servant Puck, Titania magically falls in love with a \"rude mechanical\" (a laborer), Nick Bottom the weaver, who has been given the head of a donkey by Puck, who feels it is better suited to his character.\n\nThe name Titania is thought to be derived from the Roman goddess Diana. It may also mean \"daughter of the earth\" or \"daughter of the Titans.\" Due to the massive success of the play and its status as a classic, Titania is used to name the fairy queen in many other works of fiction."

Tlaltecuhtli is also known from several post-conquest manuscripts that surveyed Mexica mythology and belief systems, such as the Histtoyre du méchique compiled in the mid-16th century.\n\nIn one of the Mexica creation accounts, Tlaltecuhtli is described as a sea monster who dwelled in the ocean after the fourth Great Flood, an embodiment of the raging chaos before creation. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, in the form of serpents, tore her in half, throwing half upwards to create the sky and stars and leaving the other half to become the land of the earth. She remained alive, however, and demanded human blood.\n\nAlthough the deity's name is a masculine form in the Nahuatl language, most representations of Tlaltecuhtli exhibit distinctly female characteristics, and the figure is often posed in the characteristic position of a woman giving birth. She is sometimes associated with Cihuacoatl, Tonantzin and Tonatiuh."

Just as they govern the movements of celestial bodies, they are also said to be in control of the seasons, stars, moon and even the sun, therefore, what is witnessed throughout the vast reaches of space concerning the orbiting of planets, arrangement of stars, as well as specific suns set for a system are all manipulated by the Virtues."

	"background":"Vishnu, rarely known as Adideva, is one of the primary deities in the Hindu pantheon. He is called The Preserver and is known for a kindly demeanor and genuine interest in the welfare of humanity. In the Hindu religion, Vishnu the Preserver is one of the three principle deities of the Trimurti (Hindu male Triad) along with Brahma, the Creator, and Shiva, the Destroyer. He was first seen in early Vedic mythology as the god that assisted Indra in defeating Vritra and is now the supreme deity within Vaishnavism, a branch of Hinduism that focuses on the worship of Vishnu. As the preserver, Vishnu maintains balance within the world, and at the end of our current aeon he will appear as his final avatar Kalki and judge whether mortals have been good or evil. After this, the universe will end and creation will start anew. He is depicted with up to four arms, blue skin, holding a chakra wheel, a lotus flower, a mace and a conch, and rides on the back of Garuda. He also sleeps on the back of a great Naga named Ananta Shesha.\n\nVishnu's first prominent appearance in later Hindu mythology was in the form of his first avatar, the fish Matsya, where he warned the first human, Manu, about a great flood that was soon to come and to tow his ship full of plants and animals to the mountains where they would avoid the high water levels. After this he appeared in many incarnations, both as humanoids and animals, throughout Hindu tales. Probably the best known incarnation of Vishnu was within the Hindu epic Ramayana, where he appeared as the hero Rama who set out to save his wife Sita from the rakshasa king, Ravana.\n\nHe is the husband of the goddess Lakshmi in all her incarnations and has ten personal incarnations starting with Matsya and ending with Kalki. He may also be worshipped in the form of Harihara, the perfect fusion of Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nHe is known to have countless avatars (the word avatara is generally put after the avatars' names), but these ten are considered the most important:\n\nMatsya - The fish avatar. Plays a role in the story of Manu (the first man in Hindu myth) by warning him of an impending flood.\nKurma - The tortoise avatar. Supports a sacred mountain on his back during the churning of the ocean in order to obtain Amrita.\nVaraha - The boar avatar. Is known to have rescued the earth (sometimes in the form of a woman) out of the ocean after she either falls in or a demon pushes her in.\nNarasimha/Simha - A half man, half lion avatar. Kills the invulnerable demon Hiranyakasipu.\nVamana - The dwarf priest avatar. Tricks the benevolent demon king Bali by demanding three footspans of land. Bali agreed and Vamana grew in size, thus occupying the Earth in one step, the Heavens in another. When asked where should he place his third foot, Bali offered his own head. Vamana was impressed and granted Bali a separate Loka for him.\nParashurama - The warlike human avatar. Born into the Brahmin caste, he carries a great battle axe given to him by Shiva to destroy all corrupt rulers. Kills the thousand-armed king Kartavirya of the Himalayas.\nRama - The kingly avatar carrying a bow and arrow. A popular mortal hero in Hinduism and the central figure in the epic Ramayana. Kills many demons including the Rakshasa, Taraka, Kabandha and Ravana.\nKrishna - The Mahabharata avatar. The central character in the Bhagavad-Gita / Song of the Blessed Lord, in which he is the charioteer for Arjuna.\nBuddha - The historical avatar. The only avatar that can be connected to an actual person, though some historians debate that Buddha was made an avatar to bring his worshippers back into the Hindu fold or weaken the demons in their war against the gods by converting them to Buddhist beliefs.\nKalki - The avatar that is yet to be. He is the coming avatar who will ride in on a white horse, sword in hand, to end the evil of the current age (called Kali Yuga), and usher in a new time of prosperity. His coming is prophesied to happen sometime in the next 400+ years."

The Lady of the Lake is usually referred to by various spellings of her other names. In some depictions, the Lady of the Lake is a title belonging to both Vivian and Nimue.\n\nMerlin had met Nimue at the Fountain of Barenton (Brittany) and fallen so deeply in love with her that he agreed to teach her all his mystical powers. Nimue became Merlin's scribe, who recorded his prophecies, as well as his lover. Unfortunately however, over the years, Nimue became so powerful that her magical skills outshone even her teacher and she imprisoned him in Glass Tower. In English legend, she was said to be slain by Balin.\n\nTo some extent she stepped into Merlin's role at King Arthur's side, but the old man's removal contributed considerably to the great monarch's downfall. Vivian was eventually obliged to reclaim her sword when Arthur was fatally wounded at the Battle of Camlann and Excalibur was hurled back to misty waters. She was later one of the three Queens who escorted the King to Avalon.\n\nSince Nimue's place as Merlin's student and lover was largely overtaken by Morgan Le Fay, a lady whose very name in Breton indicates a water-nymph, it seems that the two were once aspects of the same character. As both appear among the three queens who escort Arthur to Avalon, she no doubt had a third aspect making up the well-known theme of a Celtic Triple-Goddess.\n\nNimue is thought to be related to Mneme, the shortened form of Mnemosyne, one of the nine water-nymph Muses of Greco-Roman Mythology who gave weapons, not unlike Arthur's sword, to the heroic Perseus."

It traditionally represents conquest, bearing a bow of conquest, with the \"pestilence\" association first appearing in the 20th century. This Horseman is one of confusion amongst theologians as some believe he is representative of divine conquest (and thus a force of good) while others think of him as a representative of unlawful conquest (and thus a force of evil).\n\nOther interpretations include the rider of the white horse as Christ, whose conquest represents the spread of Christianity, or the Antichrist, who rides across the world to deceive those who are pious and faithful. Regardless of his morality the Horseman is said to arrive and sweep across the world, unleashing civil war and internal strife, which separates him from War, who embodies more open warfare."

The fundamental premise in all instances is the same: a phantasmal group of huntsmen with the accoutrements of hunting, horses, hounds, etc., in mad pursuit across the skies or along the ground, or just above it.\n\nSeeing the Wild Hunt was thought to presage some catastrophe such as war or plague, or at best the death of the one who witnessed it. Mortals getting in the path of or following the Hunt could be kidnapped and brought to the land of the dead. A girl who saw Wild Edric's Ride was warned by her father to put her apron over her head to avoid the sight. Others believed that people's spirits could be pulled away during their sleep to join the cavalcade.\n\nThe hunters may be the dead or the fairies (often in folklore connected with the dead). The hunter may be an unidentified lost soul, a deity or spirit of either gender, or may be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, Woden (or other reflexes of the same god, such as Alemannic Wuodan in Wuotis Heer (\"Wuodan's Host\") of Central Switzerland, Swabia etc.), or Arawn. Some believe that the Wild Hunt came from the Norse god Odin and his valkyries with their horses.\n\nMedieval legends of the Wild Hunt are mostly from the area encompassed by modern-day Germany, where it was also known as the \"Wild Army,\" or \"Furious Army.\" There, its leader was given various identities, including Wodan (or \"Woden\"), Knecht Ruprecht (cf. Krampus), Berchtold (or Berchta), and Holda (or \"Holle\"). The Wild Hunt is known from the post-medieval folklore of Germany, Czech Republic, Ireland, Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and to a lesser extent, Norway.\n\nIt has been variously referred to as Wilde Jagd (German: \"wild chase\") or Wildes Heer (German: \"wild host\"), Herlaþing (Old English: \"Herla's assembly\"), Woden's Hunt, Herod's Hunt, Cain's Hunt, the Devil's Dandy Dogs (in Cornwall), Gabriel's Hounds (in northern England), Ghost Riders (in North America), Mesnée d'Hellequin (Old North French: \"household of Hellequin\"), Cŵn Annwn (Welsh: \"hounds of Annwan\"), divoká honba or štvaní (Czech: \"wild hunt,\" \"baiting\"), Dziki Gon or Dziki Łów (Polish) and Oskoreia or Åsgårdsreia (Norwegian: \"ride of Asgard\"). The origin of this name is uncertain, and the reference to Asgard is reckoned to be a corruption by some scholars (a Dano-Norwegian misinterpretation)."

At one time, Ox-Head and Horse-Face attempted to capture him, but Wukong overpowered them and scared them away.

Buddha grants Wukong a challenge he is unable to overcome and thus he is imprisoned under the Five Finger Mountain for 500 years until he is freed by Tang Sanzang and joins his journey towards India with two other companions, Zhu Baijie and Sha Wujing, to obtain the Hindu scriptures, along with encountering a variety of demons along the way who act as antagonists.\n\nSome believed that Sun Wukong's conception was influenced by the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman, but there are also opinions arguing that Ramayana had not yet been translated into Chinese language during the lifetime of the author of Journey to the West, thus theorize that their resemblence was mere coincidence."

This great crow was sent from heaven as a guide for Emperor Jimmu on his initial journey from the region which would become Kumano to what would become Yamato. It is generally accepted that Yatagarasu is an incarnation of Taketsunimi, but none of the early surviving documentary records are quite so specific. None of the sources mention about it having three legs either, and it may have been influenced by the Chinese sun bird Huoniao."

It was believed that if colored light was seen inside a well (likely caused by light reflection) then the Yurlungur was within.\n\nIn one story of the Yurlungur, he was awoken from a deep sleep by the smell of one of the Wawalag sisters' menstrual blood. Aroused by the smell of the blood, Yurlungur swallowed the Wawalag sisters whole, however it was later forced to regurgitate them both. The act of the serpent regurgitating them is used in Aboriginal ceremonies to symbolize a boy entering manhood."
